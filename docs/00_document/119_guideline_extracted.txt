의료지도(Medical Oversight) 3
1. 의료지도의 개요
◦ 의료지도는 119법 법령의 테두리 내에서 일정한  권한과 책임을 부여받아 응급의료의 질을 
향상하기 위해 수행되는 업무로써, 의사의 지도하에 이루어지는 병원 전 응급의료로 정의된다. 
◦ 의료지도는 크게 지도의사가 현장에 출동하거나 통신 등을 통하여 직접 환자의 병원 전 
처치에 참여하는 직접 의료지도(direct medical oversight) 와 지침개발 및 적용, 교육 훈련 
및 평가, 질 관리를 통해 수행되는 간접 의료지도(indirect medical oversight) 의 두 가지 
형태로 분류할 수 있다.
◦직접 의료지도 는 현장에서의 응급처치에 대하여 통신을 통해 직접 지도를 받는 것으로 
지도의사에 의한 직접 지시와 이에 대한 책임으로 가장 효과적인 병원 전 응급처치 를 제공할 
수 있으나, 직접 의료지도가 효과적이기 위해서는 적절하게 환자의 정보를 수집·분석하고 
행동할 수 있는 출동 구급대원의 능력이 전제 되어야 한다.
◦간접 의료지도 는 매우 포괄적인 의료지도 유형으로 직접 의료지도가 아닌 모든 형태의 
의료지도가 포함될 수 있으며, 의사의 의료지도를 받을 수 없는 상황에서도 기본적인 
응급처치를 할 수 있도록 표준화된 간접 의료지도 프로토콜인 표준업무지침을 활용하여 
역할을 수행할 수 있는 것을 말한다. 
2. 직접의료지도 요청지침
◦ 일반적으로 다음과 같은 경우 직접 의료지도를 요청을 한다.
󰠂본 지침에서 다루지 못했거나 적용하기 어려운 상황에서 환자 처치를 위해 필요한 경우
󰠂전문적인 환자의 의학적 상태 평가가 필요한 경우
󰠂응급처치를 거부하는 환자에 대한 조언이 필요한 경우
󰠂소생 불능 환자에 대해 소생술 유보 및 중단 여부의 판단이 필요한 경우
󰠂응급조치가 불필요한 환자에 대한 판단이 필요할 경우
󰠂환자 이송병원 선정에 대한 조언이 필요한 경우
󰠂상황별 응급처치 지침에서 정한 “직접 의료지도 요청 기준”에 해당하는 경우
󰠂2급 응급구조사의 업무범위 이상의 응급처치가 필요한 경우
◦ 소속 지역과 연계된 지도의사에게 통신을 통해 연결 후 일반적으로 다음과 같은 순서로 
직접 의료지도 요청을 한다.
󰠂의료지도 요청을 하는 구급대원의 소속 지역, 소속기관, 자격, 성명을 밝힌다.

의료지도를 통해 환자에게 처치가 이루어지는 약품을 말하며, ‘소모품’은 응급처치에 사용되는 1회용 소모품을 의미한다.
2) 구급장비운영담당자는 119구급대 운영에 필요한 구급장비 등 구매계획을 수립하여야 하며, 
매년 익년도 예산편성을 할 때 구급대별 필요수량을 파악하여 반영하여야 한다.
3) 다음 각호의 절차에 의거하여 구매절차를 진행한다.
가) 구급장비운영담당자는 구급장비 구매계획을 수립하고, 각 구급대에서 필요로 하는 장비의 
종류와 수량 등을 파악한다. 이때 구급대별 필요장비에 대한 장비규격서를 작성하게 한다.
나) 구급장비운영담당자는 각 구급대에서 요청된 결과에 따라 장비구매를 위한 심의회를 개
최한다. 이때 위원장 1명, 위원 4명이상, 간사 1명으로 구성된 장비구매 심의위원회를 
구성하며, 이때 구급대원 1명 이상이 반드시 포함되어야 한다. 단, 소방서 단위별로 화재·구조·구급 등 장비구매를 일괄적으로 추진하는 경우, 장비구매를 위한 심의회 개최시, 
심의위원으로 구급대원 1인 이상이 반드시 포함되어야 한다.
다) 심의위원회에서 결정된 구매목록과 수량에 따라 세부구매계획을 수립하고, 예산규모에 
따라 적정한 계약방법에 의거하여 계약을 체결한다.
라) 장비가 납품되면 관능검사를 실시하고 물품관리시스템에 등록 관리한다.마) 각 구급대는 배정된 장비에 대한 장비편람을 관리하며 다음 각호의 내용을 포함해야 한다.
󰠂관리번호, 내용년수
󰠂품명, 보유수량, 배정일자, 운용부서
󰠂용도, 구성품, 사용방법, 사진

Part 2  Ⅰ 119구급대 운영지침
31바) 구급장비담당자는 구급장비에 대하여 평균 연1회 구매하고, 의약품 및 소모품은 반기별 
또는 분기별로 구급대 실정에 맞게 구매를 추진한다. 이때, 구급차에 적재하는 장비, 의약
품 및 소모품은 ‘구급장비 보유기준’에서 정하는 바에 따라 구매한다.
󰠂의약품의 배정, 소모, 유효기간 도래로 폐기한 경우 의약품대장에 기록 유지한다. 배정받은 
의약품은 유효기간을 확인하여 기간별로 보관한다.
󰠂유효기간이 만료된 의약품은 문서로 보고 후 보건소, 의료기관, 폐기업체 등을 통해 폐기한다.
󰠂소모품 구매는 각 구급대별 출동건수에 비례하여 구급장비담당자에게 신청한다. 특히, 
심장충격기 패드, 심전도 전극 등 응급처치에 필수적인 품목은 구급활동에 지장이 없도록 한다.
사) 사용 중인 구급장비가 고장 나서 보수를 필요로 하는 경우, 소방서 구급장비담당자에게 
‘소방장비관리법’ 에 의거한 양식으로 행정적인 절차를 밟아 보고하고, 즉시 보수하여 
정상적인 운영이 가능하도록 한다.
아) 구급장비가 보수중이거나 현장 활동 중 분실된 경우 응급의료 서비스의 공백이 발생하지 
않도록 안전센터에서는 반드시 여유분의 장비를 비치하여 관리, 운영한다.
자) 구급대 질적 향상을 위해 각 소방서마다 응급처치용 기자재와 실습공간을 확보하여 
운용하며 실습기자재 및 마네킹의 목록과 수량은 ‘구급장비 보유기준’에서 정하는 바에 
따른다.

구급차 구급장비 및 기능2
구급차에 필요한 장비는 소방청 고시로 정하고 있다. 그러나 의료 기술의 발전과 사회 여건의 
변화에 따라 새로운 처치가 도입되기도 하고 이전에 효과적이라고 했던 처치가 실제로 그렇지 
않음이 밝혀지기도 한다. 따라서 구급차에 필요한 장비와 약품에 대한 규정은 의학적인 연구 
결과에 근거하여 지속해서 관리 ․감독 되어야 하며, 적절한 장비와 약품을 갖추도록 할 필요가 
있다.

응급처치 및 이송거부3
1. 목적
◦ 응급처치 및 병원으로의 이송거부를 하는 환자에 대한 현장 지침을 제공한다.
◦ 법적근거 : 119구조구급에 관한 법률 시행령 제21조(응급환자 등의 이송거부)
2. 방침
◦ 환자의 권리
󰠂환자가 만 19세 이상의 성인 이며 적절한 판단력 을 행사할 수 있는 건전한 정신 상태라면 
응급처치 및 이송을 거부할 수 있는 권리가 있다.
󰋼적절한 판단력이란 자신의 결정으로 인해 발생하는 결과를 바르게 이해할 수 있는 능력이다.
󰠂환자가 미성년자 이거나 적절한 판단력을 행사할 수 없는 경우 에는 법적인 대리인 (부모 
또는 가족)이 판단을 대신할 수 있다. 단, 법적 대리인이 없거나 법적 대리인의 동의를 
구할 수 없는 경우에는 지도의사의 지도를 받아 환자를 처치 및 이송할 수 있다. 
󰠂개인의 자율적 권리보다 공공의 이익이 우선하는 다음의 경우는 제외 한다.
󰋼자해 또는 자살의 위험이 있는 환자
󰋼감염성 질병이 있거나, 타인에게 해를 가할 위험이 있는 환자
◦ 구급대원의 의무
󰠂구급대원은 환자 또는 그 보호자(법적 대리인)가 응급처치 및 이송을 거부하는 경우에 이송
하지 않을 수 있다.
󰠂다만, 환자의 병력, 증상 및 주변상황을 종합적으로 평가하여 응급환자라고 인정할 만한 
상당한 이유가 있는 경우에는 환자의 이송을 위하여 최대한 노력해야 한다. 또, 환자 또는 
보호자의 의견이 불일치하고 환자가 적절한 판단력이 있는 경우 환자의 의견을 우선한다.
◦ 업무지침
󰠂응급처치 및 이송을 거부하더라도 환자의 질병이나 손상에 근거하여 적절한 환자 평가를 
시행한다.(환자가 평가를 거부하는 경우에는 가능한 단순명료한 말로 환자에게 이송 
및 처치거부로 발생할 수 있는 잠재적 위험에 대해 설명하며 의료지도를 요청한다.)
󰠂환자가 응급처치나 이송을 거부하는 경우 다음의 지침을 따른다.
󰋼환자가 적절한 판단력이 있는지 평가하여, 19세 미만이거나 적절한 판단력의 행사가 
어렵다고 평가되는 다음의 사항 이 있는 경우 의료지도를 요청한다.

소생술 유보5
1. 목적
◦ 회생 가능성이 없는 환자에 대한 소생술 유보지침을 구급대원에게 제공하여 응급의료자원을 
효율적으로 운영하고, 재난·범죄 대응 등에 도움이 되도록 한다.
2. 방침
◦ 과학적 근거와 사회적 통념 상 심폐소생술 제공이 효과가 없다고 판단될 때에는 소생술을 
시행하지 아니할 수 있다.
◦ 회복불능 상태를 판정하거나 예측하는 것은 매우 어렵기 때문에 예후가 불확실한 상황이라면 
응급처치 및 소생술을 시작하고, 처치를 시행하는 동안 추가적으로 환자에 대한 정보를 수집하면서 직접 의료지도를 요청한다.
◦ 구급대원은 소생술 유보의 판단이 필요한 경우(DNAR* 등 포함) 반드시 의료지도를 
요청하고 지도에 따르며, 심폐소생술을 시행하지 않는 경우 현장보존 및 경찰 등에 인계한다.  
*  D o  N o t  A t t e m p t  R e s u s c i t a t i o n

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
48󰠂연명의료결정법에 따라 연명의료중단 결정이 내려진 환자
3 . 절 차  및  방 법
◦ 무반응·무맥·무호흡을 확인한다.
◦ 심전도를 측정(패치 또는 3유도 심전도를 통해 측정)한다.
- 단, 다수사상자 발생 시 지연환자는 제외한다.- 패치를 부착할 수 없는 경우(손상이 심한 경우 등)에는 객관적 증빙자료(사진 등) 및 상황을 
기록지에 등록한다.
◦ 소생술 유보가 필요한 경우 직접 의료지도를 요청한다.
◦ 소생술 유보 시간, 장소, 환자평가 및 의료지도 내용 등을 정확히 기록한다. 
4. 주의사항
◦ 사망의 진단은 의사만이 할 수 있으므로, 구급대원은 환자의 사망(소생술 유보, 소생술 중단 
등)과 관련된 판단이 필요할 경우 반드시 직접의료지도를 요청한다.
◦ 노환, 만성질환(암, 심부전, 신부전 등) 등으로 환자가 집이나 요양원 등에서 임종을 맞이한 
후 법적대리인 등이 소생술 등 응급처치 등을 거부하고 단순히 병원 및 장례식장 등으로 
이송을 원하는 경우도 반드시 의료지도를 요청한다. 임종기 환자에 대해 형식적인 
심폐소생술이나 지연된 심폐소생술을 시행하지 않도록 주의하고, 심폐소생술을 시행하지 
않은 경우 현장보존 및 경찰 등에 인계하고 일지에 상세히 기록, 필요한 경우 보호자 및 
인계자에게 확인 서명을 요청할 수 있다.  
◦ 환자를 사망에 이르게 한 정황(기저질환, 사망 전 환자 상태)이 명확하지 않은 경우 법적 
대리인이 소생술 유보를 원하더라도 의료지도를 요청하며, 이송/미이송 여부는 지도의사가 
판단하도록 한다. 
◦ 사망은 범죄·상속 등 다양한 법적 문제와 연결된다는 것을 유념하고 직접·물리적 확인조치 
없이 외견상 확인만 하여서는 아니 되며, “3. 절차 및 방법” 의 절차를 모두 이행하도록 한다.

Part 2  Ⅰ 119구급대 운영지침
49◇ 연명의료결정제도(2018.2.4.연명의료결정법 시행)
◦ 연명의료결정제도란, 임종과정에 있는 환자가 무의미한 연명의료를 시행하지 않거나 중단할 
수 있는 기준과 절차를 마련하여 국민이 삶을 존엄하게 마무리 할 수 있도록 돕는 제도
◦ 연명의료란, 임종과정에 있는 환자에게 하는 의학적 시술로서 치료효과 없이 임종과정의 
기간만을 연장하는 것(연명의료결정법 제2조제4호 및 동법 시행령 제2조)
◦ 연명의료 결정(유보 또는 중단) 절차
 ① 의료기관윤리위원회가 설치된 의료기관에서 
 ② 임종과정에 있는 환자라는 의사의 의학적 판단과 [담당의사와 전문의 1인]
 ③ 환자 또는 환자 가족의 결정으로 작성 [사전연명의료의향서, 연명의료계획서] ④ 환자가 의사표현 할 수 없는 의학적 상태이면서 사전연명의료의향서나 연명의료계획서가 
없는 경우에는 환자가족 2인 이상 진술 또는 환자가족 전원합의를 통해 결정
※ 주의사항
 ① 사전연명의료의향서와 연명의료계획서는 연명의료 정보처리시스템의 DB에 보관되어야 
법적 효력 인정
 ② 연명의료를 시행하지 않더라도, 통증 완화를 위한 의료행위와 영양분 공급, 물 공급, 산소의 
단순 공급은 지속
 ③ 연명의료 결정 철회는 환자 본인만 가능하나 가족이 연명의료를 원하는 경우에는 의학적 
판단과 환자가족과 상의하여 환자에게 필요한 처치를 제공할 수 있음, 즉 구급대원의 응급
처치 및 응급의료기관으로의 이송 필요성이 발생할 수 있다.
 ④ 연명의료계획서가 있다고 하더라도 아직 임종과정이라는 판단이 없다면 이 법에 따른 
이행이 아니므로 가족과 이행시기의 적절성을 논의할 필요가 있다.
 ⑤ 연명의료 유보/중단 결정에 대한 판단이 어려운 경우에는 의료지도를 요청, 환자의 상태와 
가족의 의사를 전달하고 의료지도에 따른다.

제공하여 응급의료자원을 효율적으로 운영할 수 있게 한다.
2. 방침
◦ 환자의 회생 가능성에 대한 판단이 조금이라도 불확실한 경우 응급처치 및 소생술을 계속한다.
◦ 응급환자의 사망에 대한 판단은 법적으로 의사만이 할 수 있으므로, 소생술 중단을 결정하는 
경우 반드시 직접 의료지도를 받는다.
◦ 현장에서 소생술을 중단할 수 있는 상황1 
󰠂자발순환이 회복된 경우
󰠂구급대원이 지쳐서 더 이상 소생술을 지속할 수 없는 경우
󰠂구급대원이 소생술을 지속하기 어려운 환경에 노출되는 경우
󰠂소생술을 시작하였지만, 시행 중 ‘소생술 유보’의 조건이 확인된 경우
󰠂직접의료지도를 요청하여 ‘소생술 중단’의 의료지도를 받은 경우
3. 주의사항
◦ 저체온증, 익수, 임신부, 18세 이하 환자에 대해서는 심폐소생술 중단을 지양하고 엄격하게 
판단해야 한다.2
◦ 현장에서 소생술을 중단하는 경우 이송/미이송의 판단은 지도의사가 결정하도록 한다. 
미이송으로 결정된 경우 현장보존 및 경찰 등에 인계한다.
◦ 이송 중에 소생술을 중단하는 경우 지도의사의 지도를 받아 환자를 병원으로 이송하도록 
한다.

◈ 병원 전 응급환자 분류(Pre-KTAS) 이송 지침(안)
 
1. 기본 지침
◦ Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS)는 2016년 1월부터 우리나라 전국의 응급의 료
기관에서 사용 중인 한국형 응급환자 분류 도구로 환자의 중증도를 5단계로 분류한다. 이를 
통해 응급의료기관에 내원한 환자 상태를 평가하여 진료의 우선순위를 결정하고 잠재적인 
응급환자를 조기에 선별할 수 있게 되었다. 그러나 병원 단계의 응급환자 분류는 병원 전 단계의 응급환자 분류와 목적이 달라 단순히 병원 단계의 응급환자 분류 도구를 병원 전 
단계에 그대로 적용할 수는 없다. 병원 단계의 응급환자 분류의 목적은 ‘이미 병원에 도착한 
환자의 치료 우선순위를 정하고 의학적으로 안전한 진료 대기시간을 확인함’에 있다. 병원 전 단계의 응급환자 분류의 목적은 ‘환자가 신속하고 안전하게 치료를 받을 수 있는 병원을 
선정함’에 있다. 따라서 병원 전 단계의 응급환자 분류 도구에는 추가 항목이 필요하다.
◦ Pre-KTAS는
① 현장에서 사용이 용이하며, 분류에 소요되는 시간이 짧아야 한다.② 분류에 사용되는 용어들이 생소하지 않으며 직관적이어야 한다.③ 시간을 다투는 처치가 필요한 대표적인 응급질환 사례를 제시하고, 환자 수용이 가능한 
의료기관으로의 이송에 대한 지침이 필요하다.
④ 기존의 KTAS와 같이 5단계로 구성하고 실제 119구급대가 현장에서 적용 가능하여야 
한다.
◦ 119구급대원이 Pre-KTAS를 적용하여 응급환자 분류에 활용한다면 환자를 가장 적절한 
병원으로 이송하여 보다 나은 응급의료서비스를 제공할 수 있게 될 것이다.

󰠂B 호흡(Breathing)
󰠂C 혈역학적 상태(Circulation/hemorrhage control)
󰠂D 신경학적 장애(Disability; neurological) 
󰠂소아의 첫인상 평가는 소아평가 삼각형(Pediatric Assessment Triangle)을 적용하여 
환자의 상태를 확인한다.
• 전반적인 의식상태(Appearance)
• 호흡노력(Work of Breathing)
• 순환(Circulation)
◦ 2단계(활력징후) : 환자의 혈압, 맥박, 호흡, 산소포화도, 체온 등을 측정하여 환자 상태를 
평가하는 과정이다.
◦ 3단계(주증상 결정) : 주증상은 환자가 호소하는 증상으로 경정하며 다양한 증상 또는 상반된 
증상을 호소하는 경우 증상 중 가능 높은 Pre-KTAS 단계를 적용한다. 
◦ 4단계(1차/2차 고려사항) : 1차 고려사항은 활력징후 뿐만아니라 통증, 출혈성 질환, 
사고기전 등을 포함한다. 2차 고려사항은 환자에게 적절한 응급도를 부여하기 위해 1차 
고려사항을 보충하는 목적에서 사용된다.

Part 2  Ⅰ 119구급대 운영지침
615. 주의사항
◦ 병원 도착 전 환자 상태가 변경되면 추가 Pre-KTAS 단계를 결정하여 구급활동일지에 기록
하며, 변경사항을 이송 병원에 사전에 알리거나 의료진에 전달한다.
◦ 구급대의 현장 처치 후 환자 상태가 회복되더라도 시간이 지남에 따라 악화될 수 있으므로 
Pre-KTAS 단계를 낮추어 지정하지 않는다.
◦ 병상부족으로 환자를 수용할 수 있는 병원이 없더라도 환자를 이송 의료기관에 따라 
분류하지 않으며 환자의 상태에 맞춰 분류해야 한다.
◦ 환자 이전 결과에 따라 일반화하여 분류하지 않는다. 만성질환자, 주취자 등 비응급환자, 
반복 신고자의 증상을 일반화하지 않도록 주의한다. 
◦ 환자의 안전성을 위해 과소분류(Under triage)보다 과분류(Over triage)를 지향하는 것이 
적절하므로 두 단계 중 분류가 어려울 경우 높은 단계를 선택한다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
142◦ 구급대원은 얼굴마비를 평가하기 위해 이마를 찡그리거나 혀를 내밀거나, 입을 오므리는 
등의 이학적 검진을 실시한다.
◦ 구급대원은 팔의 편측 근력저하를 평가하기 위해 양측 눈을 감고 손바닥을 위로 해 양 팔을 
똑바로 앞으로 뻗어 10초간 유지시킨다. 한쪽이 내측으로 회전하면서 떨어지거나, ‘탁’하고 떨어지면 마비가 있다고 판단한다.
◦ 구급대원은 환자가 혀가 잘 돌아가지 않아 구음장애가 있는지 혹은 발음이 불가능하거나 
부적절한 언어를 사용하는 실어 등이 있는지를 평가하고 기록 한다.
◦ 얼굴마비나 팔 위약이 하나라도 비대칭이거나 발음이 비정상이면 ‘양성’임. 좌우 모두 마비가 
있으면, 선별검사 양성이 아니다.
◦ 환자가 급성 의식저하로 병원 전 뇌졸중 선별검사를 시행하지 못하는 경우 최종 결과는 
양성으로 구별한다.
◦ 환자 협조가 안되거나 거부할 경우에도 표준 뇌졸중 척도를 평가하기 위해 최대한 노력한다.

◦ 신시네티 병원 전 뇌졸중 선별검사(Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale, CPSS)는  
뇌졸중 여부를 빠르게 선별하기 위한 도구이며, 신시네티 뇌졸중 분류 평가 도구(Cincinnati 
Stroke Triage Assessment Tool, CSTAT)은 뇌졸중의 중증도를 평가하기 위한 도구이다. 중증 뇌졸중 환자의 경우 뇌혈관 근위부나 내경동맥의 폐쇄가 동반된 경우가 있어 
혈전제거술을 시행하는 것이 도움이 될 수 있다. 최근 연구에서 동맥 폐쇄가 동반된 중증 
뇌졸중 환자에서 마지막으로 정상 상태를 확인한 16-24시간 내에 혈전제거술을 시행한 환자에서 그렇지 않은 환자보다 뇌졸중의 후유증이 적었다는 보고가 있었다.
◦ 주시편위는 양쪽 눈이 한쪽 방향으로 쏠려있는 경우를 의미한다. 환자에 따라서 쏠린 
반대편으로 눈을 일부 움직일 수도 있으며, 아예 움직이지 못할 수도 있는데 모두 비정상으로 
판단한다.
◦ 팔위약정도는 신시내티 병원 전 뇌졸중 선별검사와 동일한 방식으로 확인한다. 양측 눈을 
감고 손바닥을 위로 해 양 팔을 똑바로 앞으로 뻗어 10초간 유지시킨 후 한쪽이라도 팔이 
내측으로 회전하면서 떨어지거나, ‘탁’하고 떨어지면 비정상으로 판단한다.
◦ 나이/시간(월) 지남력은 환자에게 나이와 현재 달(current month)에 대한 질문을 하여 확
인한다. 두가지 질문 중에 하나라도 제대로 답하지 못하면 비정상으로 판단한다. 

Part 2  Ⅰ 119구급대 운영지침
143◦ 눈감기/손잡기 펴기 동작 수행은 환자에게 눈감기와 손고 펴기의 동작을 수행하게 하여 
확인한다. 두가지 동작 중에 하나라도 제대로 하지 못하면 비정상으로 판단한다.
◦ 뇌졸중 중증도 평가 개별 검사 결과를 통해 뇌졸중 중증도 점수를 확인할 수 있다. 
주시편위가 있는 경우 2점 (없는 경우 0점), 팔 위약이 있는 경우 1점(없는 경우 0점)을 
부여한다. 나이/시간(월) 지남력이 비정상적인 경우 0.5점을 부여한다. 눈감기/손잡고 펴기 
동작 수행 비정상인 경우 0.5점을 부여한다. 총 4점중 2점 이상인 경우 최종 중증도 평가 양성으로 구별하며, 중증 뇌졸중 환자로 판단한다.

◦ 환자가 뇌졸중의 과거력이 있으면, 구급대원은 뇌졸중이 허혈성인지 출혈성인지 문진하여 
기록하도록 하며, 또한 후유 장애로 인해 팔 다리의 위약이나  발음 이상 등의 증상이 남아
있었는지 확인한다.
◦ 뇌졸중 선별검사 시에 이전의 후유증과 비교하여 이상이 있는 소견만을 양성 소견으로 판단
한다.

Part 2 Ⅱ 119상황실 운영지침
1571. 수보단계 중증응급환자 인지 프로토콜의 세부 운영지침
1) 기본 질문
① 구급상황 확인◦ 다음과 같은 질문을 통해 도움 요청이 구급 상황임을 확인한다.
 1. 119입니다. 무엇을 도와드릴까요? (구급 상황 확인)
② 환자 발생 장소 및 도움 요청자의 전화번호 확인
◦ 구급 상황인 경우 도입부 질문에서 환자 발생 장소 및 도움 요청자의 전화번호를 먼저 확인
한다. 갑자기 발생할 수 있는 연락 두절에 대비하기 위해 중요한 과정이다.
◦ 자동위치추적장치, 발신자 자동식별 (automatic number identification)에 의해 
확인되더라도, 가능한 도움 요청자가 발생 위치와 전화번호를 말하도록 하여 재확인!
 2. 환자가 발생한 위치가 어디입니까?
 3. 전화번호가 어떻게 됩니까?
③ 주증상(출동대상 범주) 확인
◦ 다음의 질문을 통하여 주증상(출동대상 범주)을 확인한다.
 4. 무슨 일이 발생했는지 정확히 말해주시겠습니까?
   (재난 및 다수사상자 발생사고 의심 시) 환자가 몇 명이나 됩니까?
- 도움 요청 및 신고자가 환자와 같이 있지 않거나, 사고 현장에 있지 않아 현장 상황 및 
환자 상태를 전혀 알 수 없는 경우는 “환자상태 파악 불가능” 코드를 선택한다.
◦ 주증상 확인 시 조기 긴급출동지시를 내려야 하는 경우
- 다음과 같은 상황이 의심되는 경우는 구급차 조기 긴급출동지시를 내리도록 한다.
 ◦ 심정지
 ◦ 심정지에 준한 상황
   ▶ 명백한 사망징후 없는 목맴(Hanging) 및 호흡없음   ▶  질 식 ( S u f f o c a t i o n )
   ▶ 물에 빠짐(Underwater)
   ▶ 기도이물   ▶ 교통사고, 추락 등 외상성심정지
 ◦ 6명 이상의 환자 발생(다수 환자)하거나, 발생이 의심되는 경우

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
158- 구급차 조기 긴급출동지시를 내린 후, 심정지에 준한 상황의 경우 즉각 응급처치 안내를 
시행할 수 있도록 상담요원에게 연결한다.(다수환자 발생은 제외)
- 6명 이상의 환자 발생(다수 환자): 신고자가 6명 이상의 환자가 발생했다고 하거나, 6명 
이상의 환자가 발생했을 것이라고 의심되는 경우

상담단계 심폐소생술 및 즉각 응급처치 안내 프로토콜4
1. 목적
◦ 심정지/호흡정지 혹은 심정지에 준한 상황의 환자에서 구급차가 현장에 도착하기 전까지 
도움요청자에게 심폐소생술/즉각 응급처치를 시행할 있도록 안내하는 것을 목적으로 함.
2. 정의
◦ 도착전 심폐소생술 안내 (DA_CPR; dispatcher assist_CPR)
- 심정지/호흡정지 상황에서 구급대원이 현장에 도착하기 전까지 신고자에게 전화(음성/영상 
혹은 다른 통신수단)를 통하여 심폐소생술을 할 수 있도록 안내하는 것을 말함.
- 신고자가 휴대전화를 가지고 있는 경우, 휴대전화의 스피커를 켜거나 영상통화로 연결하여 
심페소생술을 시행할 것을 안내하도록 한다.
- 신고자를 통해 파악된 환자의 상태가 명확하지 않은 경우 영상통화로 연결하여 환자의 
상태를 파악할 수 있으며 통화 연결로 인해 환자의 응급처치가 지연되어서는 안된다.
◦ 영상 심폐소생술 안내 (VA_CPR; Video assist_CPR)
- 심폐소생술 안내 방법 중 영상통화를 활용한 심폐소생술 안내 방법을 말함. - 영상통화를 연결한 경우 심폐소생술 시행자의 정면(환자의 측면)에서 환자와 심폐소생술 
시행자가 모두 보이도록 휴대전화의 위치와 각도를 조정하도록 지시한다.
- 영상통화를 연결한 경우에도 심폐소생술 프로토콜을 따르며 상황에 따라 동영상 재생, 
움직이는 이미지(*움직이는 이미지, GIF*), 그림책, 마네킹 등을 활용한다.
- 통신장애, 휴대전화의 스피커나 영상의 품질 문제 등으로 인해 영상통화를 통한 
심폐소생술의 안내가 부적절하거나 지연될 가능성이 있는 경우 영상 심폐소생술 안내를 
즉시 종료하고 일반적인 심폐소생술 안내를 시행한다.
◦ 즉각 응급처치 안내
- 심정지에 준한 상황(목맴, 호흡없음, 질식, 물에 빠짐, 기도 이물, 교통사고, 추락 등 외상성
심정지)에서 질식 상황이 지속되는 것을 막기 위해 신고자에게 응급처치를 할 수 있도록 안내하는 것을 말함.
 3 .  운 영  원 칙
◦ 심폐소생술/즉각 응급처치 안내는 시행자의 안전을 우선 고려하여야 하며, 감염의 가능성이 
없는지를 우선 확인시킨 후 안전이 보장되는 경우에 시행하도록 한다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
178◦ 의식이 없고, 호흡이 불확실한 경우 추가 질문을 통해 호흡유무를 평가한다.
호흡이 불확실한 경우
추가 질문1 환자의 가슴이 오르락 내리락 합니까? (예, 아니오)
추가 질문2 환자의 숨소리를 표현해 보세요.
추가 질문3환자가 숨을 쉴 때마다 숫자를 불러보세요.
(10초 이상=임종(agonal)/비효과적(ineffective)인 호흡으로 간주)
신고자로부터 정상 호흡 여부를 판단하기는 쉽지 않다. 종종 빈사호흡 (agonal respiration)을 정상 호흡
으로 혼동할 수 있다. 따라서 흉곽이 일정한 리듬에 따라 규칙적으로 움직이는 것으로 정상 호흡 여부를 확인하도록 한다. 추가 질문2 간혹 신고자들은 빈사 호흡에 대하여 다음의 단어들로 표현할 수 있다.
1) 간신히
2) 힘겨운3) 헐떡거리는
4) 코를 고는

심정지(비외상성)  1
심정지는 환자의 의식, 호흡(비정상적 호흡 포함)과 맥박이 없거나 심전도 모니터 상 심실세동, 
무맥성 심실빈맥, 무수축 및 무맥성 전기활동(PEA)이 보이는 경우에 해당한다. 비정상적 호흡은 
흔히 임종호흡으로 불리며 분당 3~4회의 매우 느리고 불규칙하며 힘들게 호흡하는 모습을 보인다. 
간혹 호흡과 함께 ‘끅’ 하는 소리가 나기도 한다.1
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 질병으로 인하여 24시간 이전에 사망할 것이 예견되지 않던 환자에서 증상 발생 2시간 
이내에 심정지가 발생한 것을 ‘급성 심정지’ 라고 하여 심인성 심정지일 확률이 높으며 
심실세동 등 악성 부정맥의 경우 신속한 제세동 치료 가 소생술 성공에 결정적이다.2
◦ 가역적인 원인인 저혈량혈증, 저산소증, 대사성 산증, 저/고칼륨혈증, 저체온증, 긴장성 
기흉, 심장압전, 독성물질, 폐동맥혈전증, 관상동맥혈전증(급성심근경색) 등으로 2차적으로 
심정지가 발생할 수 있으므로 이러한 원인을 찾으려는 노력이 중요하다.3 
2. 환자평가 필수항목 
◦ 현장 안전을 확인하고 감염방지 조치를 취한다.
󰠂의식 확인 및 호흡, 맥박을 평가하여 심정지 여부를 확인한다.4
󰠂심정지의 원인이 외상, 목맴, 질식, 익수 에 해당하는지 확인한다.5 
◦ 심전도 모니터가 부착되어있는 경우 ‘무수축’ 확인으로 맥박 평가를 대신할 수 있다.
◦ 심정지 목격 여부, 일반인 심폐소생술 실시, 심정지부터 심폐소생술 시작까지 시간, 심정지
부터 심장충격기 부착 및 제세동까지 시간 등이 환자의 생존과 생존 후 신경학적 결과에 영향을 미치므로 이에 대한 정보를 수집해야 한다.
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법6
◦ 심정지로 확인되면 심장충격기를 준비 한다.7 ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
󰠂구급대원은 현장도착과 동시에 심장충격기를 가져간다
󰠂환자에게 제일 먼저 심장충격기를 적용하되, 구급대원이 2인 이상일 경우 심장충격기 
준비와 함께 심폐소생술이 동시 다발적으로 이루어질 수 있다.8 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
194◦ 가슴압박  ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
󰠂구급대원은 필요할 경우 일반인에게 심폐소생술 참여 혹은 근처의 자동심장충격기를 가져올 
것을 권유할 수 있으며 해당 일반인이 심폐소생술을 할 경우 가슴압박만을 실시할 수 있다.9
󰠂현장 도착 시 한꺼번에 여러 가지 일을 동시에 시행해야 하지만 가슴압박을 충실하게 진행
하는 것이 최우선적이다.
󰠂흉골(복장뼈-sternum)의 아래쪽 절반 부위를 최소 5 cm 깊이(6 cm 초과 안됨)로 분당 
100~120회 정도 속도로 빠르게 압박하며 압박 후 충분히 이완 되도록 한다.10
󰠂구급대원이 2인 이상일 경우 적절한 가슴압박이 시행되고 있는지 압박  깊이, 속도, 압박 
대 이완의 비(1:1) 등을 지속적으로 상호 점검하고 격려한다. 적절한 가슴압박을 모니터하기 
위하여 메트로놈, 흉부저항감시장비, 가슴압박품질측정 장치 등을 사용할 수 있다.11
󰠂전문처치 및 원활한 심폐소생술을 위하여 필요시  가슴압박을 위한 기계식 압박 장비를 
사용할 수 있으며 장비사용 방법은 관련 술기 지침을 따른다.
※ 환자를 들것으로 이동하거나, 운행 중인 구급차, 열차 및 항공기 등 좁은 공간, 소생술이 
길어지거나 인력이 부족한 경우 또는 감염병노출 위험 등 특수한 상황에서는 가슴압박의 
중단을 최소화하기 위해, 압박장치의 비적응증을 제외하고 적극적으로 기계식 압박 장비의 
사용을 고려한다.12
◦ 기도확보 및 호흡보조13
󰠂환자에게 외상의 증거가 없을 경우 모든 구급대원은 기도확보를 위하여 도수조작을 
시행하고 입인두기도기를 삽입(☞ ② ①)한다.14 
󰠂구급대원이 백밸브마스크를 사용할 수 없는 경우(인력부족, 자격부족)   심장압박을 
지속하면서 비재호흡마스크로 15L/min 산소를 공급할 수 있다.15 
☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂구급대원이 백밸브마스크를 사용할 수 있는 경우 가슴압박이 효율적으로 시행되는 동안 
백밸브마스크를 사용하여 15L/min 산소를 가슴압박 30대 호흡보조 2로 제공한다.(☞ ② 
①) 시행방법은 백밸브마스크 술기 지침을 따른다.16
󰠂심정지의 원인이 외상, 목맴에 해당하면 하악견인법(Jaw thrust) 으로 기도 확보하며 경추
고정을 고려한 후 호흡보조를 시행한다.17 ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
󰠂심정지의 원인이 익수 혹은 약물중독으로 인한 질식성인 경우  반드시 기도확보 후 백밸브
마스크를 이용한 호흡보조를 시행한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ① 익수에 의한 심정지는 익수 지침을 
따른다.18
◦ 전문기도유지술  ☞ 1급 응급구조사 등

Part 3  Ⅰ 현장응급처치 표준지침
195󰠂전문기도유지술은 후두마스크 등을 비롯한 성문주위 기도확보 장비 및 기관내 삽관을 포함
한다.
󰠂전문기도유지술 시행 자격 및 방법은 기본심폐소생술 및 기도삽관, 성문 상 기도기 술기 
지침을 따르며 가능하면 구급차 이송이 시작되기 전에 시행한다.
󰠂기도확보가 적절히 시행되었는지 환자의 양측 흉부의 상승의 육안적 확인, 호흡음의 청진, 
호기말 이산화탄소 측정장비 등을 사용하여 기도확보가 적절히 시행되었는지 반드시 확인
한다.19 ☞  ②  ①
󰠂전문기도유지술이 시행된 경우  백밸브마스크의 마스크를 제거하고 전문기도삽입장비와 
연결한 후 분당 10회의 속도로 가슴압박의 이완기에 호흡을 보조한다. 전문기도유지술이 
시행된 후 가슴압박(☞ Ⓕ ② ①)은 가능한 중단 없이 시행되도록 한다. 과환기 되지 않도록 
지속적으로 주의한다.20
󰠂기관 내 삽관을 시행한 후에는 호기말 이산화탄소 측정 장치(end tidal CO 2 detector)를 
적용한다. 장비사용 방법은 관련 술기 지침을 따른다.21
◦ 자동심장충격기 리듬 확인22 ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
󰠂자동심장충격기의 패드 부착은 가슴압박과 호흡보조에 방해되지 않게 가능한 신속히 
이루어지도록 하며, 현장에서 반드시 심장충격기를 사용 하도록 한다.( 구급차 운행 중에 
정차중이고 시동을 끈 상태에서는 리듬분석 가능 함.) 자세한 시행방법은 자동심장충격기 
술기 지침에 따른다.
󰠂자동심장충격기의 리듬이 분석되는 동안 가슴압박 및 호흡보조를 멈춘다. 
󰠂제세동이 필요하지 않은 경우 즉시 가슴압박을 비롯한 심폐소생술을 시작한다.
󰠂제세동이 필요한 경우 충전버튼을 누르고(장비에 따라 자동으로 충전되는 경우도 있음) 
충전되는 동안 가슴압박을 시행한다. 충전이 완료되면 가슴압박을 멈추고 환자에게서

1974 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항
◦ 환자의 맥박을 10초 이상 확인하지 않으며 맥박이 불확실 한 경우 심폐소생술을 시작한다.30
◦ 제세동 시행 후 심장충격기의 가슴압박 음성지시를 기다릴 필요 없이 제세동 시행 직후 
가슴압박을 지체 없이 시작 해야 한다.31
◦ 제세동 리듬을 분석 간격인 2분(5cycle) 동안에는 제세동 가능리듬이 관찰 혹은 
심장충격기에 의한 리듬분석 지시 등이 있더라도 이를 무시하고 가슴압박을 지속한다. 즉, 
리듬을 분석하기 위해 가슴압박을 멈추지 않는다. 
◦ 현장에서는 되도록 심장충격기 전원을 끄거나 환자에게서 제거하지 않는다. 단, 현장에서 환자 
이동시 현장상황에 따라 심장충격기를 끌 수 있으나, 이동 후 신속하게 전원을 연결한다.
◦ 환자의 움직임, 자발호흡, 소리(기침), 심전도 상 정상리듬(동맥의 파형 등), 호기말 
이산화탄소의 급격한 상승 등이 관찰되지 않는 한 환자의 소생여부를 확인하기 위하여 
심폐소생술을 중단하고 의식 확인, 맥박촉지 및 혈압측정을 하지 않는다.32
◦ 자발호흡 및 순환 회복시 환자의식이 회복되더라도 삽입한 기도유지기 및 성문주위 기도확보 
장비 또는 기관내 삽관은 제거하지 않는다.(단, 환자의 의식이 명료하여 구역반사 등을 보일 
때는 의료지도 후 제거 할 수 있다.)
◦ 협소한 엘리베이터가 있는 공동주택에서는 혈액 순환을 유지할 수 있도록 환자의 적절한 
체위 유지를 위해 노력하고, 가슴압박의 중단을 최소화한다.
◦ 정맥로 확보: 심폐소생술 시 에피네프린 투약을 위해 선호되는 혈관은 손등, 손목, 그리고 
팔오금에 위치한 혈관들이다. 카테터는 16-18게이지 정도의 굵은 카테터를 사용하며, 
카테터의 열린 상태를 유지하기 위하여 생리식염수를 연결하여 수액을 지속 주입하도록 한다. 심정지 치료에서 가장 중요한 것은 고품질 가슴압박과 제세동 가능리듬에서의 빠른 
제세동이다. 정맥로 확보 및 에피네프린 투약을 위하여 고품질 가슴압박을 멈추거나 제세동 
가능리듬에서 제세동을 지연시켜서는 안된다. 정맥로 확보의 국소적 합병증으로 혈종, 연조직염, 혈전증, 정맥염 등이 생길 수 있으며, 전신 합병증으로 패혈증, 폐색전증, 
공기색전증 등이 발생할 수 있다.

5. 비말접촉으로 전파 가능성이 있는 감염병(의심)환자 처치 시 주의사항34
◦ 가슴압박이나 제세동을 실시하는 경우 반드시 해당 감염병에 따른 지침에 부합하는 
감염보호복을 착용하여야 한다.35 
◦ 환자와의 접촉 최소화를 위해 처치하는 구급대원 등의 인원을 최소화하고 기계식 압박 장비를 
사용할 수 있다.36   

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
198◦ 전문기도유지술이 필요한 경우 환자의 입에 가까이 가지 않도록 가능한 비디오 후두경을 
사용하여 기관내 삽관을 우선 시행하도록 하며, 기관내 삽관에 실패했을 경우 성문 상 
기도기를 삽입하거나 헤파필터(HEPA Filter)를 연결한 백밸브마스크로 인공호흡을 
실시한다. 전문기도유지술을 실시한 경우에도 헤파필터를 연결하여 인공호흡을 하여야 
한다.37
◦ 소생술 종료 후 감염관리지침에 따라 개인보호장비와 구급장비를 폐기 및 소독하고 손을 
충분히 씻는다.
※ 감염병 종류에 따라 별도의 지침이 있는 경우 그 지침을 따른다. 
6. 직접의료지도 요청기준
◦ 심폐소생술 유보 및 중단의 경우(‘소생술 유보 및 소생술 중단지침’ 참조)
◦ 위 지침에서 다루지 못한 특수한 상황이나 보다 전문적인 의학적 평가 및 처치가 필요한 
경우
◦ 이송병원 선정에 관한 조언이 필요한 경우(예: 장거리 이송 등)
◦ 구급대 팀의 리더가 에피네프린 정맥주사 투여, 전문기도기 삽입이 필요하다고 판단한 경우 
7. 이송병원 선정지침
◦ 가장 가까운 지역응급의료기관 이상의 병원으로 이송함을 원칙으로 한다.
◦ 이송병원 선정이 어려운 경우 직접의료지도를 요청하고 지도에 따른다. 
◦ 지역 내 이송병원 선정지침이 있을 경우 지역 지침에 따라 이송할 수 있다.
※ 성인 심정지 원인에 대한 조사(5H5T)38
◦ 5H : 저혈량증, 저산소증, 산증, 저/고칼륨혈증, 저체온증
◦ 5T : 폐혈전증, 심근경색, 긴장성기흉, 심장눌림증, 약물중독

심정지(외상성)  2
외상성 심정지는 둔기 또는 관통 등 외상으로 인해 출혈, 외상성 뇌 손상 또는 중추신경계 
손상으로 발생한다. 즉각적인 의료처치 없이는 사망에 이를 수 있는 응급상황이다. 외상성 심정지는 
생존율이 매우 낮고, 즉각적인 의료중재에도 불구하고, 양호한 신경학적 상태의 생존율도 매우 
낮다. 최근 몇 년 동안 외상성 심정지 환자의 생존율을 개선하기 위한 프로토콜이 제안되었지만 
다양한 요인과 복합 외상으로 인해 이러한 프로토콜을 표준화하기 어려운 실정이다.1
 
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 외상성 심정지는 먼저 심정지의 원인을 찾고 개선해야 한다는 의미에서 비외상성 심정지와 
차이가 있다. 외상 상황에서 심정지를 초래할 수 있는 몇 가지 가역적인 원인을 신속하게 
평가하고, 특정 원인에 대한 중재를 우선 실시해야 한다. 심폐소생술과 동시에 수행되어야 
하며 이는 심정지 후 처음 10~15분 내에 수행되어야 한다.2
◦ 외상성 심정지의 가역적 원인 및 치료
환자상태 치료목표 초기 치료 확실한 치료
저혈량증3-8순환량 회복IV 통하여 수액공급, 지혈대 및 붕대, 
(골반골절시) 골반고정밴드를 이용하여 
출혈조절수혈
긴장성 기흉9-12흉강 내 압력완화 (양압환기)바늘감압술 흉관삽입
혈흉13흉강 내 압력완화 (양압환기) 흉관삽입
심낭압전14-17심낭 내 압력완화 심낭천자 개흉술
저산소증18-19혈액내 산소 증가기도유지, 호흡조절
백밸브마스크,비인두기도기,
구강기도기 등 기도장치기관내삽관
※밑줄표시 는 구급대원 중 응급구조사/간호사의 업무범위가 아님을 명시 
◦ 외상이 생긴 이후 심전도는 가장 흔히 무맥성 전기 활동(PEA) 형태로 나타난다. 이는 촉진되지 
않는 저혈압 상태를 나타내며 기저질환이 교정되지 않으면 무수축으로 진행된다.20-23
◦ 다량의 출혈이 있는 환자에게 심장압박과 에피네프린만으로는 충분한 혈압을 달성하지 못할 
수 있으며 역효과를 낼 수도 있다.24-26
◦ 기본소생술은 신체 전반에 걸쳐 산소 공급 및 순환을 유지하는 것을 목표로 하는 것에 반해, 
외상성 심정지의 경우 가슴압박으로 인해 오히려 대량 출혈을 초래할 수 있다.27
◦ 대량 실혈로 인해 총 혈액량이 줄어들면 심폐소생술 효과가 없을 수도 있다.

Part 3  Ⅰ 현장응급처치 표준지침
2032. 환자평가 필수항목 
◦ 의식 확인 및 호흡, 맥박을 평가하여 심정지 여부를 확인한다.
◦ 심정지의 원인이 대량출혈, 긴장성 기흉, 혈흉, 심낭압전, 저산소증 등에 해당하는지 
확인한다.28-29 
◦ 외상성 심정지 목격 여부, 손상기전 확인, 가역적 원인 교정을 위한 노력 등이 환자의 생존과 
생존 후 신경학적 결과에 영향을 미치므로 이에 대한 정보를 수집한다.
◦ 외상성 심정지와 관련된 비특이적 징후 및 증상을 확인한다. 발한, 정신 상태 변화, 빠르거나 
느린 호흡, 외상 징후(타박상, 열상, 골절) 등을 고려한다.
◦ 고령이거나 손상이 적은 환자가 심정지일 경우 내과적 원인에 의한 심정지의 가능성이 있으
므로 비외상성 심정지 처치 기준에 따른다.
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ 현장 안전을 확인하고 감염방지를 위한 조치를 취한다.
◦ 명백한 사망의 징후가 없거나 소생술 유보, 중단할 수 있는 명백한 근거가 없다면 추가적인 
평가 및 이송을 준비하는 동안 소생술을 시작한다.
◦ 심정지로 확인되면 심장충격기를 준비한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂현장도착과 동시에 심장충격기를 가져간다. 
󰠂구급대원이 2인 이상일 경우 외상성 심정지 가역적 원인을 판단하며 심장충격기를 준비하는 
동안 다른 구급대원은 심폐소생술을 시행한다.
󰠂심폐소생술은 다음의 기도확보, 호흡보조, 가슴압박을 포함한다.  
◦ 가역적인 원인을 확인하고 동시에 중재한다.
- 외부출혈이 있다면 압박지혈, 지혈대 적용한다. 골반 및 대퇴골절 있을시 골반고정대 및 
부목 적용한다.30-32
- 대량출혈이 의심되면 의료지도 하에 정맥로 확보를 통한 등장성 정질액(생리식염수, 플라
스마솔루션, 하트만솔루션) 투여를 우선 고려한다.
- 저산소증, 흉부손상이 의심되면 양압환기 시행하고, 의료지도 하에 전문기도유지술을 우선 
고려한다.
◦ 기도와 호흡을 평가하며 기도확보 및 호흡보조한다.
󰠂환자에게 외상의 증거가 없을 경우 모든 구급대원은 기도확보를 위하여 도수조작을 
시행하고 입인두기도기를 삽입(☞ ② ①)한다.
󰠂구급대원이 백밸브마스크를 사용할 수 없는 경우(인력부족, 자격부족)  심장압박을 지속하면

󰠂심정지의 원인이 외상, 목맴에 해당하면 하악견인법(Jaw thrust)으로 기도 확보하며 경추
고정을 고려한 후 호흡보조를 시행한다.  ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂심정지의 원인이 익수 혹은 약물중독으로 인한 질식성인 경우 반드시 기도확보 후 
백밸브마스크를 이용한 호흡보조를 시행한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ① 익수에 의한 심정지는 익수 지침을 따른다.
- 호흡음을 청진하고, 환기 중 호흡음이 감소하거나 부적절한 가슴벽의 움직임이 있으면 긴장
공기가슴증을 고려해야 한다.
- 긴장성 기흉이 있다고 판단되면 바늘감압술이 가능한 가장 가까운 병원 이송을 우선 고려한다.
◦ 가슴압박 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂구급대원은 필요할 경우 일반인에게 심폐소생술 참여 혹은 근처의 자동심장충격기를 가져올 
것을 권유할 수 있으며 해당 일반인이 심폐소생술을 할 경우 가슴압박만 실시할 수 있다.
󰠂흉골(복장뼈-sternum)의 아래쪽 절반 부위를 최소 5 cm 깊이(6 cm 초과 안됨)로 분당 
100~120회 정도 속도로 빠르게 압박하며 압박 후 충분히 이완 되도록 한다.
󰠂구급대원이 2인 이상일 경우 적절한 가슴압박이 시행되고 있는지 압박 깊이, 속도, 압박 
대 이완의 비(1:1) 등을 지속적으로 상호 점검하고 격려한다. 적절한 가슴압박을 모니터하기 
위하여 메트로놈, 흉부저항감시장비, 가슴압박품질측정 장치 등을 사용할 수 있다.
󰠂전문처치 및 원활한 심폐소생술을 위하여 필요시 가슴압박을 위한 기계식 압박 장비를 
사용할 수 있으며 장비사용 방법은 관련 술기 지침 및 장비 설명서를 따른다.
◦ 환자가 현장소생술에 효과적으로 반응하지 않는다면 빠른 이송을 고려한다.
※ 환자를 들것으로 이동하거나, 운행 중인 구급차, 열차 및 항공기 등 좁은 공간, 소생술이 
길어지거나 인력이 부족한 경우 또는 감염병 노출 위험 등 특수한 상황에서는 가슴압박의 중단을 최소화하기 위해, 압박장치의 비적응증을 제외하고 적극적으로 기계식 압박 장비
의 사용을 고려한다.
◦ 전문기도유지술 ☞ 1급 응급구조사 등
󰠂기관내 삽관에 대한 충분한 훈련·경험이 없는 구급대원은 성문 상 기도기를 사용하고, 
충분한 훈련·경험이 있는 구급대원은 기관내 삽관을 실시한다.

󰠂자동심장충격기의 패드 부착은 가슴압박과 호흡보조에 방해되지 않게 가능한 신속히 
이루어지도록 하며, 현장에서 반드시 심장충격기를 사용하도록 한다.(구급차 운행 중에 
정차중이고, 시동을 끈 상태에서는 리듬분석 가능함.) 자세한 시행방법은 자동심장충격 
기술기 지침에 따른다.
󰠂자동심장충격기의 리듬이 분석되는 동안 가슴압박 및 호흡보조를 멈춘다. 
󰠂제세동이 필요하지 않은 경우 즉시 가슴압박을 비롯한 심폐소생술을 시작한다.
󰠂제세동이 필요한 경우 충전버튼을 누르고(장비에 따라 자동으로 충전되는 경우도 있음) 충전
되는 동안 가슴압박을 시행한다. 충전이 완료되면 가슴압박을 멈추고 환자에게서 떨어진 후 
제세동을 시행한다. 제세동을 시행한 이후 바로 가슴압박을 비롯한 심폐소생술을 재개한다.
󰠂자동심장충격기 리듬은 5주기(30:2를 1주기)마다 혹은 2분마다 분석한다.
◦ 심폐소생술은 ‘2020 심폐소생술 가이드라인’ + PHTLS 기준으로 적용하고, 현장에서 순수한 
소생술(CPR 준비, 이송 및 기타 시간 제외) 시간을 최소 6분 이상으로 하고 처치 시간 및 
추가적 응급처치는 지도의사의 의료지도를 받아 처치 후 이송할 수 있다. 단, 외상성 심정지는 필요한 응급처치를 우선으로 제공하여야 한다.
◦ 이송의 시작
󰠂심정지의 원인이 외상, 목맴, 질식, 익수에 해당하지 않으면 반응시간에 따른 지속적 
가슴압박 시행 후 이송을 시작한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂이송 시작 전 필요 시 정맥로를 확보(☞ ①)할 수 있다. 정맥로 확보를 위해 가슴압박을 
중단하거나 이송의 시작을 지연시키지 않는다.
◦ 이송 중 심폐소생술
󰠂구급차 운행 중 심폐소생술을 지속하며 적절히(가슴압박의 지속성, 속도, 깊이, 호흡보조의 
효과성(기도확보가 적절히 유지되고 있는지 등)) 이루어지고 있는지 점검한다. 이를 위하여 
지속적 호기말 이산화탄소 측정장비를 사용(☞ ①)할 수 있다.
󰠂이송 중 제세동 가능리듬을 확인하기 위하여 구급차를 멈추는 것은 구급차 교통사고 발생 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
206및 안전사고 등이 발생될 수 있으므로 가능한 자제한다. 
◦ 사전연락 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂이송시작 전에 이송할 병원에 사전 연락을 취하여 환자의 소생술이 연속될 수 있도록 한다. 
󰠂구급대원은 소방상황실에 이송할 병원에 사전 연락 및 수용가능 여부를 확인해 줄 것을 
요청하고 환자의 상태 및 병원도착까지의 예상시간 등의 정보가 이송할 병원에 전달될 
수 있도록 노력한다. 
◦ 환자 인계 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂구급대는 이송한 병원의 소생술이 시작될 때까지 소생을 위한 노력을 지속하여야 한다.
󰠂이송병원의 의료진에게 심폐소생술 시행에 관련한 환자 정보를 전달하여야 한다.
◦ 기록 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂환자 인계 후 구급활동일지 및 중증외상+심폐정지환자 응급처치 세부상황표를 완성한다.
4 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항
◦ 빠른 이송으로 인한 교통사고 위험성에 대비하여 반드시 개인보호장비를 착용한다.
◦ 외상의 특성상 혈액 및 체액의 노출 위험이 있어 감염방지장비를 착용한다.
◦ 환자의 맥박을 10초 이상 확인하지 않으며 맥박이 불확실 한 경우 심폐소생술을 시작한다.
◦ 제세동 시행 후 심장충격기의 가슴압박 음성지시를 기다릴 필요 없이 제세동 시행 직후 
가슴압박을 지체 없이 시작해야 한다.
◦ 제세동 리듬을 분석 간격인 2분(5cycle) 동안에는 제세동 가능리듬이 관찰 혹은 
심장충격기에 의한 리듬분석 지시 등이 있더라도 이를 무시하고 가슴압박을 지속한다. 즉, 
리듬을 분석하기 위해 가슴압박을 멈추지 않는다. 
◦ 현장에서는 되도록 심장충격기 전원을 끄거나 환자에게서 제거하지 않는다. 단, 현장에서 환자 
이동시 현장상황에 따라 심장충격기를 끌 수 있으나, 이동 후 신속하게 전원을 연결한다.
◦ 환자의 움직임, 자발호흡, 소리(기침), 심전도 상 정상리듬(동맥의 파형 등), 호기말 
이산화탄소의 급격한 상승 등이 관찰되지 않는 한 환자의 소생여부를 확인하기 위하여 
심폐소생술을 중단하고 의식 확인, 맥박촉지 및 혈압측정을 하지 않는다.
◦ 자발호흡 및 순환 회복시 환자의식이 회복되더라도 삽입한 기도유지기 및 성문주위 기도확보 
장비 또는 기관내 삽관은 제거하지 않는다.(단, 환자의 의식이 명료하여 구역반사 등을 보일 때는 의료지도 후 제거 할 수 있다.)
◦ 협소한 엘리베이터가 있는 공동주택에서는 혈액 순환을 유지할 수 있도록 환자의 적절한 
체위 유지를 위해 노력하고, 가슴압박의 중단을 최소화한다.

비외상성 쇼크  4
쇼크는 신체 조직에 혈액과 산소가 적절하게 공급되지 못하는 상태를 의미한다. 여기에는 
신체 외부에서 조직 내로 산소와 영양소를 이동시키는 것과 조직으로부터 노폐물을 제거하는 
것을 포함한다.
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 의식변화: 쇼크로 인해 가장 먼저 뇌가 영향을 받아 안절부절, 불안감을  유발할 수 있고 
이는 혼돈, 투쟁으로 발전하며 더욱 심해질 경우 무의식 상태가 된다. 
◦ 피부: 혈관이 수축하면서 피부가 창백하고 차가워지며1, 더욱 진행할 경우 땀이 나게 된다.
◦ 호흡: 빠르고 얕은 호흡을 하고, 더욱 진행할 경우 호흡수는 감소한다.
◦ 맥박: 빠르고 약한 맥박이 발생한다.(단, 신경성쇼크에서 서맥(느린맥)이 발생 수 있음)◦ 쇼크의 종류에 따른 특징
󰠂저혈량성 쇼크: 구토, 설사, 수분섭취 제한, 출혈 등으로 인해 체액이 소실되면서 혈액량이 
줄어든 경우 발생한다.
2
󰠂심장성 쇼크: 심장의 펌프 작용이 약화되면서 발생한다.
󰠂신경성 쇼크: 뇌 또는 척추의 신경 손상으로 인해 혈관이 확장되어 발생한다.
󰠂패혈성 쇼크: 광범위하게 퍼진 감염과 독소로 인해 체액이 혈관 외로 이동되면서 유발된다.
󰠂아나필락시스 쇼크: 전신적인 알레르기 반응으로 인해 유발된다.
2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 병력청취 
󰠂반복적인 구토, 지속적인 설사, 토혈, 객혈, 혈변, 수분섭취 제한 여부를 청취한다.
󰠂심장 질환 유무를 확인한다.
󰠂폐렴, 욕창과 같은 감염병 여부를 확인한다. 
󰠂뱀, 벌 및 그 외 알레르기성 물질에 노출됐는지 확인한다. 
◦ 이학적 검진: 병력청취를 통한 초기 진단과 함께 시작 
󰠂의식상태: 안절부절, 혼란, 의식 저하 여부를 파악한다.
󰠂활력징후를 확인: 혈압, 맥박수, 호흡수, 체온

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
214◦ 다음은 정상 활력징후의 범위이다. 호흡수와 맥박수는 이보다 빠르거나 느린 경우, 
수축기혈압은 이보다 낮은 경우 쇼크의 가능성이 높다.
나이 호흡수(회/분) 맥박수(회/분) 수축기혈압(mmHg)
영아(0~1세) 25~50 100~160 70~95
유아(1~3세) 20~30 90~150 80~100
학령전 아동(3~6세) 20~25 80~140 80~100
학령기 아동(6~12세) 15~20 70~120 80~100
사춘기(13~18세) 12~20 60~100 90~110
성인(19~64세) 12~20 60~100 90~140
노인(65세 이상) 15~20 60~100 100~140
󰠂피부의 색깔 및 긴장도, 땀의 발생 여부를 파악한다.
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ ʻ환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침 ʼ에 따라 전반적인 평가 및 처치를 시행한다.
◦ 적절한 기도유지와 100% 산소 공급을 시작한다.
󰠂의식이 명료할 경우  비재호흡 마스크(☞ Ⓕ ② ①)를 이용해 분당 15 L 속도의 고농도 
산소를 투여한다.
󰠂의식이 ‘V’이하로 저하되고 호흡이 10회 미만이면  백밸브마스크로 환기를 보조한다. ☞ ② ①
󰠂의식이 'U'인 경우  입인두기도기 등을 삽입하고 백밸브마스크로 환기를 유지한다. ☞ ② ①
◦ 정맥로를 확보하고 수액을 보충한다.3 ☞  ①
󰠂저혈량성, 신경성, 패혈성 쇼크  
󰋼혈압, 맥박수, 의식 등이 정상 범위로 회복될 때까지 5분에서 10분마다 300ml(소아는 
5mL/kg)의 생리식염수나 젖산 링거액을 투여하고 혈압, 맥박수, 의식 등이 정상 범위로 
회복되는지 확인한다. 쇼크가 지속될 경우 1L(소아는 10mL/kg)까지 수액을 지속적으로 
투여한다.4,5
󰠂심장성 쇼크 
󰋼부정맥, 흉통 등이 있을 경우 이에 대한 처치를 시행한다.(흉통지침 참조)
󰋼수액요법: 원인이 심장기능부전이므로 폐부종이 없는 경우 생리식염수 250 mL 를 투여 
한다. 
󰠂아나필락시스 쇼크 (알레르기 및 아나필락시스 지침 참조)
◦ 저혈압일 경우  환자의 다리를 상승시키고, 호흡곤란인 경우는 머리를 상승시키는 등 적절한 
환자의 자세를 취한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①

Part 3  Ⅰ 현장응급처치 표준지침
215◦ 모포를 덮어 환자의 적정한 체온을 유지한다.4 ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
◦ 이송 중 활력징후 측정 등 지속적으로 환자상태를 감시하고 필요시 심전도 측정을 통한 
평가를 실시한다.
4 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항
◦ 쇼크의 첫 번째 활력징후의 변화는 혈압저하가 아닌 맥박의 상승 이므로 활력징후 측정 시 
빈맥(빠른맥) 여부를 우선으로 확인한다.
◦ 현장에서 병원 이송 전에 한 개 또는 두 개의 정맥로를 확보할 수 있다. 하지만 현장에서 
정맥로 확보에 시간을 너무 많이 보내면 안된다. 
5. 직접의료지도 요청기준
◦ 정맥로 확보 및 수액 투여 
◦ 수액을 투여하였으나 혈압상승, 의식 회복 등의 반응이 없을 때
6. 이송병원 선정지침
◦ 가까운 지역응급의료센터 이상의 의료 기관으로 이송함을 원칙으로 하되, 지역별 여건에 
따라 의료지도 등을 받아 치료 가능한 가까운 지역응급의료기관으로 이송할 수 있다.
◦ 단, 응급의료 취약지역일 경우 가장 가까운 응급의료기관 이상의 의료기관으로 이송한다.
◦ 위 기준에도 불구하고 이송병원 선정이 어려운 경우 직접의료지도를 요청하고 지도에 따른다.

호흡곤란  6
체내 산소의 공급과 이산화탄소의 배출이 정상적이지 않아 발생하는 증상으로 호흡기 계통
에서는 환기, 확산, 관류의 장애와 관련이 있다. 즉 공기가 폐의 내외부로 드나드는 과정의 
환기, 폐포와 폐의 모세혈관 사이에서 가스의 교환인 확산, 폐모세혈관에서 혈액순환인 관류1, 
이 세 가지를 원인과 관련하여 생각하여야 한다.
1. 임상적 특징
◦천식: 기관지 평활근 수축에 의한 가역적인 기도폐쇄로 발생하며 빈호흡의 쌕쌕거리는 소리
(천명음)가 특징적이다.
◦만성폐쇄성폐질환:  가래를 동반한 기침, 거친 나음(crackles), 만성 청색증, 흡기와 호기시 
저항을 특징으로 하는 만성 기관지염과 가래를 동반하지 않은 기침, 쌕쌕거림, 나음, 호기의  
연장을 특징으로 하는 폐기종으로 분류한다.2
◦심부전/폐부종:  심근 손상으로 심부전이 발생하면 폐정맥압 상승으로 폐부종이  발생한다. 
폐부종이 발생하면 폐포와 폐모세혈관사이에 액체가  축적되어 가스의 교환이 방해를 받아서 호흡곤란과 빈호흡이 발생한다. 심한 경우 핑크색 거품의 가래를 뱉어 낸다.
◦자연공기가슴증: 외상없이 발생하며 재발률 30 ~ 50%인 공기가슴증으로, 일차성 공기가슴
증은 뚜렷한 폐질환이 없고, 키가 크고 마른 체형, 20~40대 남성, 흡연자에서 빈발하고, 
이차성 공기가슴증은 폐질환 환자에서 빈발한다. 호흡곤란과 흉통, 기침을 주로 호소하고 
청진시 발병 부위의 폐음 감소가 특징적이다.
2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 병력청취: 호흡기 질환의 병력과 함께 호흡곤란에 관한 병력을 얻기 위해 OPQRST (Onset, 
Provocation, Quality, Region, Severity, and Time) 의 약어로 질문을 실시한다.
󰠂Onset: 호흡 곤란이 시작되었을 때 무엇을 하고 있었는지, 호흡곤란이 언제 시작되었는지, 
갑자기 시작되었는지, 서서히 악화되었는지 물어본다.
󰠂Provocation: 무엇이 호흡곤란을 유발시켰는지, 어떻게 하면 호흡곤란이  완화되는지, 
어떤 자세에서 호흡곤란이 심해지는지 물어본다. 
󰠂Quality: 숨을 들이쉴 때와 내쉴 때 언제 더 숨이 찬지, 흉통 등의 동반된  증상은 어떠한지, 
동반된 증상이 있는지 물어본다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
220󰠂Region: 어디에 증상이 있는지, 다른 곳으로 퍼지는지(radiation) 물어본다.
󰠂Severity: 호흡곤란이 어느 정도 심한지, 이전에도 이렇게 심했는지의  정도를 물어본다.
󰠂Time: 호흡곤란이 얼마나 오래 지속되는지 물어본다.
◦ 이학적 검진: 병력청취를 통한 초기 진단과 함께 시작한다.
󰠂의식상태: AVPU 측정법
󰠂활력징후를 체크한다.
⦁혈압: 저혈압(수축기혈압 < 90 mmHg), 고혈압성 위기(수축기혈압 > 200 mmHg)
⦁맥박수: 빈맥(빠른맥)(교감신경항진 또는 저산소증의 징후), 서맥(느린맥)(심한 저산소증 
→ 심정지 임박) 
⦁호흡수: 빈호흡, 호흡 양상
⦁산소포화도: 산소공급의 기준이 되는 산소포화도를 측정한다.1

흉통  8
어깨, 목, 턱 또는 등으로 방사되는 흉통이나 흉부 불쾌감은 허혈성 심질환의 흔한 증상이다.1
하지만 허혈성 심질환 환자 모두가 흉통 증상을 나타내지 않을 수 있다는 것을 주의하여야 
한다.2(특히 당뇨환자3) 협심증 은 심장 근육에 필요한 만큼의 산소가 공급되지 못하여 발생되는 
흉부 불편감 또는 통증을 말하며, 아직 심장 근육의 괴사는 일어나지 않은 단계이다. 협심증은 
신체적으로 무리한 경우, 추위에 노출된 경우, 감정적인 스트레스를 받았을 때 잘 발생되며, 심근경색과는 달리 보통 10분 이상 통증이 지속되는 경우는 없으며, 거의 대부분 
니트로글리세린에 의해 통증이 없어진다.
1,4 협심증과 달리 급성심근경색 은 심장 근육으로의 
혈류 공급이 감소하거나 중단되어 심장근육 괴사가 일어난 것으로 ST-분절 상승 심근경색 과 
ST-분절 비상승 심근경색 으로 나눌 수 있으며,1 ST-분절 상승 심근경색의 경우 즉각적인 
재관류 요법의 시행이 필요하다.

◦ 특별한 원인이 없는 갑작스런 무력감, 오심, 발한과 같은 비특이적 전신증상에서부터 흉통, 
폐부종으로 인한 호흡곤란, 부정맥으로 인한 실신, 어지럼증 등 다양한 형태로 나타날 수 있다. 
◦ 심근경색의 통증은 협심증보다 오래 지속되며, 협심증의 경우 보통 흉통이 10분 이상 지속
되지 않는다.
◦ 협심증의 경우 흉통이 휴식이나 니트로글리세린의 투여로 소실되지만 심근경색의 경우 
흉통이 경감될 수는 있으나, 심근의 허혈이 해소되지 않으므로 통증이 지속되는 차이를 
보인다.

서맥9
서맥(느린맥)은 안정 상태에서 분당 심박수가 60회 미만 인 경우로 정의할 수 있지만, 보통 
분당 심박수가  5 0 회  미 만 이 되어야 서맥(느린맥)으로 인한 증상이 발생한다. 예를 들어 
운동선수의 경우 안정시 심박수가 60회 미만인 경우가 흔하지만1-3, 느린 맥박과 관련한 증상이 
없는 경우는 비정상적인 상태로 볼 수 없으며, 치료를 필요하지도 않는다.4 이에 비해 ‘상대적인 
서맥(느린맥)’ 은 비록 환자의 맥박수가 60회 미만이 아니더라도 환자의 의학적 상태에서 
예상되는 맥박수보다 느린 경우로 정의할 수 있다. 따라서 심각한 증상을 가진 서맥(느린맥)을 
구별하는 것이 중요하며, 불량한 관류상태를 시사하는 모든 징후를 포함하여 의식변화, 저혈압, 
흉통, 호흡곤란, 실신, 울혈성 심부전 등이 심각한 증상에 포함된다.5 서맥(느린맥) 환자의 초기 
처치는 기도확보 및 산소화, 그리고 서맥(느린맥)의 원인을 찾는 것으로 시작한다.

실신은 부적절한 뇌혈류의 공급으로 인해 갑작스럽고 일시적으로 의식소실이 발생하는 
것으로 다양한 원인에 의해 발생할 수 있다. 실신과 발작을 구별하는 것이 필요하며, 실신은 
발작에 비해 보통 실신 전 증상이 있으며, 경련 움직임이 없고, 발작 후에 나타나는 혼미 상태를 
동반하지 않는다.1 여러 가지 검사에도 불구하고 실신의 원인을 찾기 어려운 경우가 많지만, 
실신의 원인 중 생명에 심각한 위협을 줄 수 있는 심인성 실신 및 저혈량성 쇼크의 동반 유무를

249급성 뇌졸중의증  15
뇌졸중은 흔히 중풍으로 더 잘 알려져 있으며, 크게 허혈성 뇌졸중 과 출혈성 뇌졸중 의 두 
가지로 분류할 수 있다. 허혈성 뇌졸중은 뇌혈전증, 뇌색전증, 열공성 뇌졸중, 일과성 
뇌허혈발작 등으로 나뉘고, 출혈성 뇌졸중은 뇌실질내출혈, 지주막하출혈, 경막하출혈 등으로 나뉜다.
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 뇌졸중의 위험 인자1
󰠂고혈압, 당뇨병, 심방세동, 무증상 경동맥협착, 기타 심장질환, 뇌혈관 질환의 과거력, 고지혈증, 
흡연, 비만, 혈액점도 증가 등
󰠂피임약 복용, 폐경후 호르몬치료, 편두통, 단백질 C, S 결핍, 고섬유원소증, 고뇨산혈증, 
빈혈, 심내막감염 등
◦ 뇌졸중의 일반적인 증상
󰠂주된 증상은 두통, 어지러움, 편마비, 언어장애, 보행장애, 의식장애 등이며, 심한 경우에는 
혼수, 호흡정지 또는 심장정지에 이르기도 한다.2
󰠂일과성 허혈발작은 일시적인 국소 허혈에 의해 발생하며, 가역적이고 일시적이나 반복되는 
양상을 보이는 경우에 뇌경색의 선행 증상이 될 수 있다.
󰠂뇌경색은 우리나라 뇌졸중 환자 중 65% 차지하며3 이전에 일과성 허혈증상을 경험한 경우에서 
50% 이상이며 갑자기 발생하기도 하고 수 시간 또는 수일에 걸쳐 진행되기도 한다.
󰠂뇌출혈은 우리나라 뇌졸중 환자 중 35% 차지하며4 활동 시간이나 격렬한 운동, 심리적 격앙 
또는 식사 도중에도 발생할 수 있으며, 부위와 출혈량에 따라 의식장애의 정도가 다양하고 
심한 경우 뇌간 탈출에 의해 사망에 이를 수 있다.
◦ 증상 발현의 특성
󰠂손상 받은 부위와 허혈, 경색이나 출혈의 정도에 따라 의식장애 및 마비 등의 증상에서부터 
혼수까지 다양한 증상을 보일 수 있다.
󰠂일반적으로 편측 대뇌의 병변으로는 의식저하와 혼수를 일으키지는 않으나, 부종 등으로 
반대 측 뇌의 기능저하가 동반되면 증상을 나타낼 수 있다.

255경련  16
경련은 중추신경계의 뇌신경 세포가 갑작스럽고 과도하게 비정상적이고 무질서한 방전이 
일어나면서 발현되는 것으로 중추신경계를 자극하는 모든 요소에 의해 유발될 수 있다. 일반적
으로 수초에서 수분 간 지속되다가 자연히 소실되어 멈추게 된다.1
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 경련성 질환의 정의
󰠂경련(Seizure) 은 뇌신경 세포의 비정상적이며 과도한 전기 활동에 의해 유발되는 일시적인 
신경학적 이상 증상 및 징후가 일어나는 상태2
󰠂뇌전증(간질, Epilepsy) 은 만성적인 기저 병변으로 인해 반복적인 경련을 보이는 상태1
󰠂뇌전증 지속상태(Status epilepticus) 는 경련이 5~10분 이상 지속되거나 또는 의식의 회
복됨이 없이 발작이 반복되는 상태 
◦ 연령에 따른 원인2
󰠂출생 ~ 6개월: 분만 전·후의 손상, 뇌의 발달이상, 선천성 기형, 중추신경계 급성 감염, 
비타민 결핍, 대사장애
󰠂6 ~ 24개월: 급성 열성경련, 중추신경계의 급성감염, 분·만 전후의 손상, 뇌의 발달 이상, 
피질 이형성증
󰠂2 ~ 6세: 중추신경계의 급성감염, 분만 전·후의 손상, 뇌의 발달이상, 특발성(원인이 잘 
밝혀지지 않은 경우), 뇌종양
󰠂6 ~ 12세: 특발성, 뇌종양, 중추신경계의 급성감염, 분만 전·후의 손상, 뇌의 발달이상
󰠂성인: 뇌외상, 중추신경계의 감염, 뇌종양, 뇌혈관질환, 알코올 또는 약물의 금단, 퇴행성 
질환3
◦ 증상 발현의 특성
󰠂초기: 호흡곤란, 타액 분비, 청색증, 혀 깨물기, 심박증가, 혈압 증가, 동공 산대 등
󰠂후기: 무반응, 근육이완, 과도한 침 흘림, 요실금, 배변, 두통, 피로, 근육통 등 
󰠂경련을 보이는 모든 시기에서 의식저하 및 의식 소실이 동반되기도 한다.
 2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 병력 청취 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
256󰠂현재 경련을 하고 있거나 경련이 끝난 직후에는 환자에게서 직접 병력을 청취하기 
어려우므로 주변의 목격한 사람으로부터 많은 정보를 얻는다.
󰠂경련 전의 증상 유무, 경련의 횟수나 지속시간, 경련의 양상 등을 확인한다.
󰠂뇌전증병력이 있는 경우, 해당 약물 복용의 여부나 약제의 종류 및 용량의 변화를 확인한다.
󰠂뇌전증병력이 없는 경우,  외상의 유무, 음독의 유무, 알코올 섭취 및 중단의 유무, 암과 
같은 기존의 전신 질환, 저산소증, 수면 부족 등의 병력을 확인한다.3
󰠂임신이나 최근의 출산 은 자간증 과 관련된 경련을 고려한다. (‘자간증’지침 참조)
󰠂과호흡증후군과 같이 외부의 심리적인 인자에 의한 경련의 발생을 고려한다. 
◦ 이학적 검진
󰠂혈압, 호흡수, 맥박수 측정
󰠂말초 산소포화도 측정
󰠂체온 측정 
󰠂혈당 측정4 
󰠂의식 수준: AVPU법 을 이용하여 분류
󰠂동공 반응
󰋼양측 동공이 축동(동공수축)되어 있으나 대광반사가 있는 경우는 대사성 뇌증, 또는 과량의 
마약을 투여한 경우
⦁양측 동공이 산대되고 고정된 경우는 심한 산소 결핍성 뇌증, 스코폴라민(scopolamine)
이나 글루테치마이드(glutethimide) 중독의 경우
󰠂통증 자극을 이용한 운동 반응
󰋼안면부의 일측에 통증을 줄 때 비대칭적으로 얼굴을 찡그리거나 환자의 하지가 외전 되면 
동측의 운동력이 약화되었음을 의미
󰋼목적이 있는 움직임인가? 일측만 주로 사용하는가? 를 알기 위해서 자발적인 운동이 있는
지 관찰
󰋼심부 건반사와 바빈스키 반사 등의 병적 반사를 조사
󰠂머리나 척추의 손상을 확인
󰠂심전도 측정 및 감시 
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ ‘환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침’에 따라 전반적인 평가 및 처치를 시행한다.
◦ 경련이 지속되는 환자 
󰠂경련을 하는 자세를 유지하며, 억지로 환자의 자세를 바꾸려고 하지 않는다.5 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①

Part 3  Ⅰ 현장응급처치 표준지침

262발열 및 패혈증성 쇼크  18
열이란 여러 가지 원인에 의해 체온이 정상범위를 넘어 증가하는 것을 말한다. 정상체온 은 
구강체온으로 평균 36.8도에서 0.4도 내외로 정의하나, 하루 중 정상적으로도 0.5~1도 정도의 
체온 변화가 나타날 수 있다. 성인의 경우 아침 6시에 체온(최고 정상체온은 37.2도)이 가장 낮고 오후 4시에 체온(최고 정상체온은 37.7도)이 가장 높다. 일반적으로 고막체온계를 
이용하여 측정한 체온이 38도 이상 인 경우 발열이라고 한다. 발열의 원인으로 가장 많은 것은 
감염, 류마티스 질환, 악성신생물 등이다. 감염 중에는 상기도 감염이 가장 많은 발열의 원인이 되며, 요로감염, 소화기계 감염 등이 다음으로 많은 원인이다.

265알레르기 및 아나필락시스  19
과민반응이란 일반적으로 인체에 해가 없는 항원에 대하여 부적절한 면역반응을 유발하는 
것을 말한다. 그 중에서도 아나필락시스는 가장 중하며 갑작스런 반응으로 저혈압, 기도폐색 
등의 다기관을 포함하는 중증과민반응을 말한다.
 
1. 임상적 특성1
◦ 아나필락시스 반응을 유발하는 원인 중 가장 많은 것은 페니실린, 세팔로스포린, 설파제 
등 주사약물이다. 아나필락시스 반응은 항원에 노출된 후 수초에서 수시간까지 발생할 수 있지만 대부분은 30분 이내에 발생한다.
◦ 경증 알레르기반응 : 가려움증, 두드러기, 오심 등 (호흡곤란, 저혈압 등은 없음)
◦ 중증 알레르기반응(맥관부종, 아나필락시스) : 협착음, 천명, 심한 복통, 호흡곤란, 빈맥(빠른
맥), 쇼크, 입술, 혀, 얼굴의 부종
2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 병력청취
󰠂원인약물이나 항원유발원 노출력
󰠂이전에 아나필락시스 발병력 또는 아토피/천식 과거력

󰠂경부 및 양측 폐부위 청진을 하여 협착음, 천명음 유무를 확인
◦ 아나필락시스 여부: 아나필락시스의 진단기준에 맞는지 확인하여야 한다.
󰠂아나필락시스는 피부, 점막, 호흡기계, 소화기계, 심혈관계, 신경계 등에서 최소 두 개 
이상의 장기에서 임상증상이 발생하는 경우가 전형적인 형태이나, 일부 벌독 알레르기 환자에서는 저혈압, 빈맥, 흉통과 같은 갑작스러운 심혈관계의 반응이 단독으로 나타나기도 
한다. 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
266󰠂아나필락시스의 진단에서 주의할 점은 저혈압이 없더라도 두 곳 이상의 장기 증상이 있는 
경우 아나필락시스로 진단할 수 있다는 점이다. 혈압 저하가 발생하기 전에 다른 장기에서 
알레르기 반응이 시작되어 진행할 수 있으므로 혈압 저하 외에 다른 장기에서 보이는 임상 증상에도 관심을 기울여 평가하고 판단해야 한다.

4 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항  
◦ 환자가 알고 있는 알레르기 원인이 있다면 더 이상 노출되지 않도록 한다.
◦ 흡기시 그렁거리는 호흡음이 있고 입술이 심하게 부어 있는 경우 , 상기도 부종으로 
기도폐쇄가 임박했음을 의미하므로 기도유지를 위하여 조기에 전문기도유지술을 고려한다.
◦ 아나필락시스로 추정된 환자에서 에피네프린 자동주사기 사용시 30kg 이상은 성인용을 
사용하고, 30kg 미만은 소아용을 사용한다.
◦ 근육 주사 위치로 대퇴부는 저혈압 상태에서도 혈류량이 유지되는 부위이므로, 다른 부위의 
근육보다도 추천된다. 
◦ 첫 번째 투약에 대한 치료 반응과 아나필락시스의 중증도에 따라 에피네프린을 추가적으로 
투여할 수 있다. 에피네프린 반복 투약은 필요에 따라 5 ~ 15분 간격으로 시행할 수 있다.
◦ 에피네프린 권고용량 투약 후 창백, 떨림, 불안, 심계항진, 어지러움, 두통 등의 부작용이 
발생할 수 있으나 대부분 일시적인 증상이다. 
◦ 심혈관계 질환이 있는 환자에서 에피네프린을 사용할 경우 급성관상동맥증후군이 발생할 
위험이 있어 주의가 필요하나 사용 금기는 아니다. 
◦ 근육 주사의 부작용으로 주사 부위에 혈종이 발생할 수 있다. 이런 경우 붕대를 사용하여 
압박하며 이송하도록 한다. 
5. 직접의료지도 요청기준 
◦ 환자 생체 징후가 불안정하여 정맥로 확보 및 수액 투여가 필요한 경우
◦ 적절한 호흡보조에도 저산소증이 지속되는 경우◦ 아나필락시스가 의심되어 에피네프린 자동주사를 사용한 근육 주사가 필요한 경우

269행동 이상 및 자살  20
행동 이상이란 정신 질환, 약물 남용 혹은 기타 질환으로 인해서 비정상적인 행동을 보이는 
경우를 말한다. 행동 이상 환자는 환자 본인 혹은 주변인에게 해를 가할 가능성이 있기 때문에 구급 대원은 현장도착 시에 일차적으로 현장 안전을 확보해야 한다. 안전을 확보한 후에 행동 
이상의 원인에 대한 평가와 필요한 응급 처치를 수행하고, 동반된 손상 혹은 중독에 대해 확인
해야 한다. 행동 이상은 정신 질환 외에 다른 내외과적 질환에 의한 증상일 수 있음을 주의해야 한다. 자살 환자의 경우에는 기본적인 접근 및 처치는 행동 이상 환자와 동일하나, 동반된 
손상이나 중독에 대한 응급처치가 필요하며, 사고 현장에 대한 경찰 통보가 필요하다.

Part 3  Ⅱ 소아응급처치 표준지침
297신생아 심정지  1
신생아(출산~생후4주까지) 사망의 약 19%는 신생아 가사(질식성 호흡 부전)로 인한 것으로 
추정되고 있으며 약 10%의 신생아는 출생 시 호흡을 개시하기까지 적절한 도움이 필요하다. 
소생술이 필요한 신생아는 약 1% 정도이다.1
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 여러 이유로 신생아에게 산소 부족이 발생하면 초기에 빠른 호흡을 보이다 결국 호흡이 
멈추게 되는데 이를 일차적 무호흡 이라고 한다. 이때는 아기의 발을 두드리는 등의 자극으로 
호흡이 회복된다.2
◦ 일차적 무호흡 후에도 적절한 산소 공급이 이뤄지지 못하면 헐떡거리는 호흡 후에 이차적 
무호흡 단계에 이르게 되는데 이때는 자극을 가해도 호흡이 회복되지 않고 반드시 
호흡보조를 해야하는 단계이다.3
2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 다음 3가지 질문에 모두 ‘네’ 대답이 나오면 소생술이 필요 없는 상태로 판단한다.4
- 만삭 출생아인가?
- 잘 울거나 숨을 잘 쉬는가?- 근육 긴장도가 좋은가?
◦ 맥박 확인
- 두 손가락을 이용하여 5~10초 사이에 상완동맥(위팔동맥)을 만져 맥박을 확인한다.
◦ 심전도 리듬 확인◦ 분당 호흡수, 분당 맥박 횟수 확인
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법 ☞ ② ① 
◦ 응급처치 순서는 아래 그림을 따른다.(그림 1)5
◦ 신생아 소생술의 가장 기본적인 처치는 환기이다. 가슴 압박 은 30초간의 산소 투여와 적절한 
양압 환기에도 불구하고 심박동수가 분당 60회 미만 인 경우에 실시한다.6
◦ 신생아에게 양압환기를 포함한 초기 호흡보조시 100% 산소로 시작하지 않도록 하며, 35주 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
298미만 미숙아의 경우 저농도(21~30%), 만삭아와 35주 이상의 후기 미숙아에게는 21%의 
산소로 소생술을 시작할 것을 권장한다.7,8
◦ 가슴 압박과 환기는 3:1의 비율로 시행한다. 1분 간 90번의 가슴 압박과 30번의 환기로 
총 120번의 활동이 이뤄지도록 한다.9
◦ 소생술이 필요 없는 신생아 나 안정적인 상태로 회복한 경우 라면 수건으로 닦아주고 마른 
수건이나 방포로 덮어주어 체온을 유지할 수 있도록 도와준다.10
◦ 맥박이 있더라도 산소공급과 양압환기에도 관류상태가 불량하고, 서맥(60회/분)이 있으면 
가슴압박을 시작해야 한다.
◦ 태변을 흡입하게 되면 심각한 태변흡입 증후군을 초래할 수 있으므로 아이의 어깨가 나오기 
전에 입인두를 흡인한다.11
4. 직접의료지도 요청 기준
◦ 이송 병원 선정이 어려울 경우
◦ 기관내 삽관·후두 마스크가 필요한 경우
◦ 에피네프린 투여가 필요한 경우
5. 이송병원 선정 지침
◦ 신생아 치료가 가능한 가장 가까운 지역응급의료기관 이상의 의료기관으로 이송함을 
원칙으로 하며 이와 관련한 병원 정보를 관할지역 구급상황관리센터에 요청한다.

복 부  및  골 반 손 상   6
복부 및 골반손상은 외력이 직접 복부와 골반에 전달된 둔상과 날카로운 물체 혹은 속도가 
있는 물체 등에 의한 관통상으로 나눈다. 복부손상의 증상은 매우 다양해서 외상 초기평가에서 
복부손상을 정확히 판단하기는 매우 어렵다. 복부둔상환자에서는 복강(배안)  내 출혈 가능성을 
반드시 염두에 두어야 하며 복부관통상에서는 복부내부장기의 손상 을 고려해야 한다. 골반손상 
시에는 골반강내 장기 손상 과 골반골골절에 의한 후복막강 출혈  가능성을 의심해야 한다.
1. 임상적 특징1
◦ 복부 둔상 은 교통사고, 추락, 가격 등으로 복부에 직접 압력이 전해져서 내부 고형장기나 
유강장기가 손상되어 출혈과 복막염이 유발 되거나 감속에 의해 장간막, 대혈관 등에 손상이 
발생한다. 
◦ 복부 관통상 의 경우 주로 상복부에 발생하며 흔히 간, 소장(작은창자), 횡격막, 대장(큰창자) 
등이 손상될 수 있으며 복부 장기가 체외로 노출 될 수 있다. 
◦ 복부 유강장기의 파열이나 장기손상에 의한 복강(배안) 내 출혈은 겉으로 봐서는 쉽게 알 
수가 없으며 음주, 약물복용, 뇌손상이나 척추손상, 복부주변 구조물 손상 등이 동반되는 
경우에는 정확한 평가가 어렵다.
◦ 복강(배안) 내 많은 양의 피가 고여 있어도 외형적인 변화가 없을 수 있으며 복막자극 증상이 
나타나지 않을 수 있다.
◦ 골반 뼈의 골절은 수직력과 전후 압박력에 의해 발생할 수 있으며 골반 뼈 골절에 의해 
골반강 내 장기의 손상과 쇼크를 일으킬 정도의 출혈이 동반될 수 있다. 
2. 환자평가 필수항목2,3
◦ 병력청취
󰠂복부 및 골반손상 관련 증상: 복통의 유무 및 위치, 통증의 양상
󰠂손상기전 및 사고발생 당시 상황을 확인한다.
󰠂환자의 과거력, 수술력, 투약이력, 임신여부 등을 확인한다.
◦ 신속한 외상초기평가
󰠂기도의 열린 상태를 확인하고 유지한다. 호흡곤란이 있는지 확인한다.
󰠂혈압, 맥박, 산소포화도를 포함한 활력징후를 측정한다.

이물질이 박혀 있는지 등을 확인하고 압통, 비의도적인 근긴장, 반발통 여부를 확인한다.
󰠂골반 뼈의 불안정성을 확인하기 위해 양쪽 장골마루를 눌러보되 크게 흔들지 않도록 한다. 
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ ʻ환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침 ʼ에 따라 전반적인 평가 및 처치를 시행한다.

사지 손상  8
사지 손상이란 외력에 의하여 발생하는 상, 하지의 손상을 말한다. 손상의 종류에 따라 단순한 
타박상에서 탈구, 골절 등이 발생하며 혈관이나 신경의 손상, 구획증후군이나 횡문근융해증 
등의 합병증을 동반할 수 있다. 
압궤손상은 압력에 의한 뼈, 근육, 혈관, 신경 등의 손상을 입는 것으로 지진, 교통사고, 
건축 공사장 사고, 폭발 사고, 광산 사고 등에서 주로 발생한다.1 압궤손상은 국소적으로 골절, 
내출혈, 수포형성, 부종 등을 유발하며 전신적인 순환 장애를 일으키고 손상 부위 이하의 감각을 마비시키고 맥박 소실을 초래한다.
2 
급성 구획증후군의 골절 이후 발생하는 것이 가장 흔하며(약 69%) 적절하게 처치되지 않았을 
경우 심각한 합병증을 초래하게 된다. 따라서 골절이 발생하게 되면 급성 구획증후군 발생 여부에 대해 주의를 갖고 면밀하게 관찰하여야 하며 조기 진단과 감압으로 빨리 모세혈관 
순환을 회복 시켜야 한다.
3 
횡문근융해증은 외상 및 압궤손상, 장기간 부동자세, 과도한 운동 등으로 인한 근육 손상 
이후 다량의 근세포 내 물질(미오글로빈, 칼륨, 인산염, 크레아틴 키나제, 요산염)들이 
전신순환을 하게 되면서 나타나는 일련의 과정으로 급성신부전과 동반될 경우 사망률이 높아지므로, 적절한 환자관리가 필요하며, 원인 감별을 위해서 세심한 병력청취와 감별진단을 
위한 적절한 검사가 필요하다.
4 
압궤증후군은 압궤 손상 이후 발생하는 전신증상이다. 건물 잔해 등에 신체의 일부가 눌렸을 
경우 산소 공급이 중단되어 근육조직 세포 등이 파괴된 상태에서, 갑자기 무거운 물체가 제거되면서 혈액순환이 재개되었을 때 발생하는 전신 증상인 것이다. 체액이 급속하게 조직과 
근육으로 이동하면서 저혈량성 쇼크(hypovolemic shock)에 빠지고, 파괴된 세포에서 
흘러나온 칼륨이나 미오글로빈 단백질 등 독성 물질이 급속히 혈액 속으로 흘러 들어, 비정상적으로 높아진 혈액 내 칼륨 농도가 부정맥을 일으키게 되고 미오글로빈이 신장에 
침착되면 급성 신부전으로 환자의 생명을 위협하는 것이다.

1. 임상적 특징
◦ 골절은 타박상과 명확한 구별이 어렵다. 지속적인 통증을 호소하는 부위는 골절에 준하여 
부목 고정을 고려할 수 있다. 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
350◦ 열상을 동반한 사지의 손상은 개방성 골절을 감별해야 하며 많은 경우 즉각적인 수술적인 
처치를 필요로 하는 경우가 있다.
구획증후군
(5P 징후)6 1. 통증(pain)
2. 이상감각(paresthesia)3. 마비(paralysis)
4. 부종(palpable swelling)
5. 맥박소실(pulselessness)
횡문근융해증7 1. 급성 혹은 아급성으로 발생되는 근육통
2. 일시적인 근위부의 근력 약화3. 콜라색 소변(미오글로빈의 과량 함유)
4. 고열, 구역, 구토, 의식혼란, 섬망
5. 고칼륨혈증으로 심부정맥 유발, 심하면 심정지를 일으킨다.
혈관손상8 1. 경미한 징후
- 반대쪽 사지와 비교하여 감소된 맥박- 골격계 손상이나 근위부의 새방성 손상
- 말초 신경손상
-저 혈 압- 커지지 않는 혈종
-혈 관  근 접  손 상
2 .  심 각 한  징 후
- 박동성 출혈의 관찰- 촉진상 동맥 진동
- 청진상 동맥 주변에서 잡음
- 원위부 허혈의 징후- 점점 커지는 혈종이 관찰되는 경우
3. 차갑고 박동 없는 사지가 관찰되는 것은 낮은 전신 혈압 때문일 수도 있지만, 
독립적인 맥박 이상과 반대쪽 사지의 맥박 차이는 국소 혈관 손상의 강한 지표이다. 신경 손상 증상, 모세 혈관 충혈의 지연, 골관절 손상이 보인다면 
반드시 사지 혈관 손상을 염두해야 한다.

◦ 병력청취
󰠂사지 손상 관련 증상: 통증 위치 
󰠂손상기전 및 사고발생 당시 상황을 확인한다.
󰠂환자의 과거력, 수술력, 약물복용력, 임신여부 등을 확인한다.
◦ 신속한 외상초기평가
󰠂기도의 열린 상태를 확인하고 유지한다. 호흡곤란이 있는지 확인한다.
󰠂혈압, 맥박, 산소포화도를 포함한 활력징후를 측정한다.
󰠂손상 부위의 변형, 압통, 운동제한, 부종 및 반상 출혈, 노출된 골편 유무, 골 마찰음, 가성
운동 등을 평가하고 손상부위 원위부의 관류 및 운동/감각기능  이상 유무를 알아본다.
󰠂정확한 진단을 위해서 감각 기능과 운동 기능은 반드시 따로 평가되어야 한다.
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ ʻ환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침 ʼ에 따라 전반적인 평가 및 처치를 시행한다.
◦ 손상부위에서 외부출혈이 확인 되면 멸균된 소독거즈와 탄력붕대로 압박하여 지혈 한다.(안구
출혈의 경우 제외)(‘지혈 및 상처 드레싱 술기 지침’ 참조) ☞ Ⓕ ② ① 
◦ 사지의 완전 절단  시에는 ‘절단된 조직’ 처치 술기 지침을 따른다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ① 
󰠂절단면의 보호를 위하여 생리식염수를 적신 거즈로 절단된 부분을 감싼다.

󰠂냉장용기가 없을 때에는 절단물을 넣은 통 또는 주머니 바깥에 얼음을 채울 수도 있다.
◦ 골절이 의심 되는 부위에 대한 부목고정 을 시행한다.(‘부목고정술기 지침’ 참조) ☞ ② ①
󰠂손상이 의심되는 부위의 피복을 모두 제거한다.
󰠂변형된 사지를 무리하게 정복하려 시도하지 않는다.
󰠂부목은 골절 의심 부위의 상, 하부 관절을 포함하여 적용한다.

◦ 다발성 골절이 있는 환자 의 경우 이송 중 쇼크가 발생할 수 있으므로 예상 이송 시간이 
30분 이상이고 2인 이상의 구급대원이 있다면  18G 이상으로 정맥로 를 1개 이상 확보하고 
수액을 공급한다. ☞ ①
◦ 혈압, 맥박, 호흡, 산소포화도를 지속적으로 감시(☞ ② ①)하며 이송(☞ Ⓕ ② ①)한다.
4 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항
◦ 중증손상환자 기준에 해당하는 경우 , 현장 처치시간은 최대 10분미만 으로 최소화하는 것을 
원칙으로 하고, 환자평가과정으로 인해 이송이 지연되어서는 안된다.
◦ 개방성 골절의 경우  현장에서 정복을 시도하지 않는다.
◦ 구획증후군이 의심된다면 일반적인 처치와 더불어 적절한 근막 절개술을 시행하고 모든 
구획 내 압력을 완벽하게 낮추어야 한다. 이를 위한 적절한 병원으로 이송한다.11 
◦ 횡문근융해증이 의심된다면 빠르고 적절한 생리식염수의 공급으로 급성 신부전을 예방 해야 
한다. 혈액 양을 늘려 줌으로써 사구체 여과 및 신장 혈액 양을 증가시켜 신부전을 예방할 
수 있다. 적절한 의료지도를 통해 수행한다.12 
◦ 압궤증후군은 사고 이후 4-5시간 후에 발생하기 때문에 사고현장을 목격했을 때는 압박하는 
물체를 섣불리 제거하지 말고 환자의 기도 확보를 먼저하고 구조대를 불러 응급처치를 해야 
한다.13 또한 쇼크를 예방하기 위하여 수액 처치를 실시한 후에 압박 요인을 제거 하는 것이 
좋다. 불규칙한 심박동 및 심장마비를 대비하여 제세동기를 우선 부착  한다. (압궤증후군은 
신체의 일부분이 장시간 압박을 당하여 근육세포가 괴사하고 이로 생성된 독소가 혈액에 
유출되어 생기는 전신 증세이기 때문에 압박을 받는 순간에는 혈액순환이 원활하지 않아 
독소가 퍼지지 않지만 압박 원인을 제거하면 혈액순환이 빨라져 독소가 온몸에 퍼지게 되고, 신체의 체액이 근육으로 급속히 이동하게 되어 저혈량성 쇼크 상태에 빠져 심하게는 사망에 
이르게 된다.

화상  1
화상 환자의 구조와 응급처치는 매우 위험할 수 있기 때문에, 현장의 안전을 확보하는 것이 
가장 중요하다. 화상이 발생한 원인에 따라 열화상, 전기화상, 화학화상, 및 방사선화상 등으로 
분류할 수 있다. 조직 손상과 피부 반응의 깊이를 기준으로 1도(표재성) 화상, 2도(부분층) 
화상, 3도(전층) 화상 으로 구분한다.

익수(침수와 익사)  4
침수는 액체(가장 흔하게는 물)에 빠져 호흡곤란을 경험하는 상태를 말하고, 익사는 
침수상태가 오래되거나, 저산소증 상태가 진행되어 심정지(사망)에 이르는 상태를 말하는 
것으로, 침수와 익사는 일련의 과정이다. 통상적으로 침수와 익사로 구분하지 않고 익수로 
용어를 통일하기도 한다.1
1. 임상적 특징
◦ 물에 빠지게 되면, 숨을 최대한 참다가 물을 폐로 흡입하게 된다. 다량의 물이 흡입되면서 
폐부종이 발생하게 되고, 결국은 저산소증이 발생하여 무호흡 및 심정지까지 이어질 수 있다. 
◦건성(dry) 익사 는 소량의 물이 흡입된 직후 신체 방어기전으로 물이 추가로 흡입되는 것을 
막기 위한 후두경련이 일어난 경우로, 다량의 물이 흡입되지 않을 수도 있으나, 역시 
저산소증으로 사망할 수 있다.

3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법
◦ ‘환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침’에 따라 전반적인 평가 및 처치를 시행한다.
◦ 조이는 의류나 보석류는 제거한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①◦ 멸균증류수 또는 식염수를 이용하여 상처를  세척한다. 출혈이 있을 경우
 깨끗한 거즈를 
이용하여 10분정도 직접 압박을 시행한다. ☞ ② ①
◦ 수축기 혈압이 90 mmHg 미만 이면 하지를 거상(☞ Ⓕ ② ①)하고 정맥로를 확보(☞ ①)하여 
300mL(소아는 20mL/kg)의 생 리식염수나 젖산 링거액을 투여(☞  ①) 하고, 혈압, 맥박수, 
의식 등이 정상 범위로 회복되는지 확인한다. 쇼크가 지속될 경우 1L(소아는 10mL/kg)까지 

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
398수액을 지속적으로 투여한다.(☞ ①)
◦ 뱀에 물렸을 경우  물린 부위를 건조드레싱 후 부목을 이용해서 움직임을 최소화 한다. 또한 
물린 부위 위(심장에 가까운 근위부)로 탄력붕대를 감은 후(단, 동맥차단 금지, 말단부위 
맥박 및 모세혈관 재충혈 확인) 심장보다 낮게 위치시키고 산소를 공급하며 이송(☞ Ⓕ ② 
①)한다.2
◦ 해파리에 쏘이거나, 말미잘에 접촉한 경우 미지근한 생리식염수로 상처를 잘 씻어내고 
문지르지 않도록 한다.4 
◦ 독물고기에 찔린 경우 미지근한 생리식염수로 상처를 씻고 환부를 따뜻하게(40 ~ 50°) 유지
한다.5
4 .  응 급 처 치  시  주 의 사 항
◦ 벌침이 남아있을 시 신용카드 등을 이용하여 부드럽게 제거한다.6
◦ 곤충에 물렸을 경우 얼음 팩을 적용하며, 독사에 물렸을 경우에는 얼음 팩을 적용하지 
않는다.(독소를 비활성화 시키지 못할 뿐만 아니라 동상의 위험성에 의한 조직괴사의 
위험성이 높아지기 때문이다.)2 
◦ 독사에 물렸을 때에는 상처를 심장보다 낮게 위치하며, 주변 환경을 조용하게 유지하고, 
환자의 움직임을 최소화 하도록 한다.2 
◦ 해파리, 독가시치, 노랑가오리의 독은 동물이 죽더라도 여전히 활동하므로 죽은 후에도 만
지지 않도록 한다.
◦ 독물고기에 쏘이거나 찔린 경우 상처부위를 문지르면 독소를 더 방출할 수 있으므로 
상처부위를 문지르지 않는다.
5. 직접의료지도 요청 기준
◦ 정맥로 확보 및 수액 투여 
◦ 전문기도유지술이 필요한 경우
◦ 뱀 항독소가 필요한 환자의 이송병원 선정 시 
6. 이송병원 선정 지침
◦ 전신적인 반응, 아나필락시스, 뱀에 물린 경우 에는 중증이므로 가까운 지역응급의료센터 
이상의 의료기관으로 이송함을 원칙으로 하되, 지역별 여건에 따라 의료지도 등을 받아 

Part 3  Ⅳ 환경응급처치 표준지침
399치료가 가능한 가까운 지역응급의료기관으로 이송할 수 있다.
◦ 특히 뱀에 물렸을 경우 에는 의료지도를 요청한 후 항독소 가 있는 지역응급의료센터 이상으로 
이송하며 관련 정보를 관할 구급상황관리센터에 요청할 수 있다. 
◦ 응급의료 취약지역의 경우 가장 가까운 지역응급의료기관 이상의 의료기관으로 이송함을 
원칙으로 한다.
◦ 국소적인 반응만 있는 경증 환자 일 경우 경우에는 가장 가까운 지역응급의료기관으로 
이송한다.

1 .  거 동 이  가 능 한  환 자 는  비 응 급 으 로  그 룹 화  할  수  있 다 .
2. 거동이 불가능하나 반응이 있는 환자는 응급으로 그룹화 할 수 있다. 3. 거동이 불가능한 환자는 긴급으로 그룹화 할 수 있는데, 여기에는 BLACK(지연) 환자가 포함
되어있으며, 이는 호흡 유무로 감별 가능하다.
◇ 2단계 : START(이송중점-후착대 도착)   ※ 임시의료소설치 되면 시작
1. 거동이 가능한 환자는 비응급 으로 그룹화하고 추후 다시 개별적인 평가를 한다. 
2. 거동이 불가능한 환자에서는 ‘R(호흡수) P(맥박수) M(의식수준)’ 세 가지 요소를 체크하고 한가지라도 
이상이 있을 경우에는 긴급, 모두 이상 없을 경우에는 응급으로 분류한다. 다만, 호흡이 전혀 
없는 환자에서는 기도 확보를 시도해보고, 호흡이 있다면 긴급, 없다면 지연으로 분류한다.

아동학대  2
아동학대란 보호자를 포함한 성인이 아동의 건강 또는 복지를 해치거나 정상적 발달을 저해할 
수 있는 신체적ㆍ정신적ㆍ성적 폭력이나 가혹행위를 하는 것과 아동의 보호자가 아동을 
유기하거나 방임하는 것을 말한다.1 아동학대의 종류로는 신체학대, 정서학대, 성 학대 및 방임
(neglect)이 있으며 이 중 방임이 가장 흔하나 119구급대에 신고 되는 경우는 대부분 신체 
및 성 학대 환자이다. 구급대원은 모든 어린이 외상 환자에서 아동 학대의 가능성을 고려해야 
한다.
1. 병력청취: 아동 학대의 가능성을 의심할 수 있는 가장 중요한 단계2
◦ 다음의 내용을 모두 확인하여 기록함
󰠂손상 후 119 신고까지의 시간이 다소 지연된 경우 의심
󰋼흔 들 린  아 이  증 후 군 ( s h a k e n  b a b y  s y n d r o m e ,  S B S ) 은  4 ~ 6 시 간  사 이 에   증 상 이  가 장  
심각해진다3
󰠂손상의 목격자를 찾고, 손상 경위를 자세하게 기술
󰠂병력의 일관성:  여러 사람 혹은 한 사람의 진술이 도중에 변경, 상충될 경우
󰠂병력의 적절성:  어린이의 발달 과정과 맞지 않는 사고 경위 제시
󰋼“침대/가구에서 떨어졌다”: 뒤집기가 가능한 생후 6~7개월 이전에는 불가능한 손상
󰋼“수도꼭지를 틀어 화상을 입었다”: 수도꼭지 회전은 생후 24개월 이후에 가능
󰠂최근 응급실 방문횟수: 비슷한 손상으로 수차례 응급실을 방문하거나 신고한 경우
󰠂보호자의 태도: 너무 공격적이거나 죄책감이 강하거나 무관심한 보호자
2. 이학적 검진
◦ 시진: 전신을 탈의하고 피부의 화상, 멍, 상처를 찾음.
󰠂멍: 멍의 색깔로 수상 시기를 판정할 수 있다는 과학적인 근거는 없음. 다만 아주 오래되어 
탈색 중인 멍과 최근 손상으로 붉은 빛이 도는 멍이 섞여 있다면 반복적 구타를 의심
󰠂이상한 화상 
󰋼다리미, 젓가락, 난로의 옆면, 격자무늬와 같은 기하학적 모양의 화상
󰋼장갑 혹은 양말을 끼운 듯 한 모양의 화상(gloves and stocking pattern): 뜨거운 물에 
담가 생긴 화상

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
416󰋼도넛 모양 화상(doughnut-shape burn): 항문을 제외한 나머지 둔부의 화상
󰋼허벅지 안쪽과 같이 생기기 어려운 부위의 화상
󰋼의심스러운 열탕 화상: 정상은 상체에 화상이 많고 하지로 갈수록 화상부위가 적어야 하나 
여기 저기 흩어진 양상의 화상은 의심해 보아야 함.
󰠂대칭적인 상처: 입 주위(재갈), 목 주위(목 조름), 귀 앞뒤(귀를 잡아당기는 손상)
󰠂물린 자국
◦ 전신상태가 불량한 경우: 발육장애, 영양실조 및 탈수, 불량한 위생상태 및 피부감염 등 
◦ 그 외 일반적인 신체 검진을 자세하게 시행한다.
3. 응급처치 절차 및 방법

노인환자  3
노인은 질병과 외상에 쉽게 노출됨은 물론 정상인보다 치료가 어렵고 많은 시간이 소요된다. 
환자평가의 우선순위(기도유지, 호흡, 순환, 의식상태 평가 등)는 연령을 불문하고 모든 
환자에게 동일하다. 그러나 노인환자는 공통적으로 많은 질병을 갖고 있어 다양한 처방약을 
복용하고, 시력 또는 청력감소로 의사소통의 어려움이 있으며, 몇몇 노인은 알츠하이머로 의식상태가 저하되는 등 젊은 환자보다 섬세한 평가가 요구된다.
1. 외상 및 질환별 환자평가 특징
◦ 낙상 
󰠂낙상은 노인 환자들에게 있어 가장 흔한 유형의 외상이다. 
󰠂노인에게 가장 흔한 낙상과 관련된 골절 부위는 몸쪽 넙다리 골절 또는 엉덩이 골절이다.
󰠂그 외에 낙상과 관련된 골절부위는 골반, 전완 먼쪽, 위팔 몸쪽, 갈비뼈, 목뼈 등이 있다.
󰠂노인 환자의 낙상평가 시 둔부, 골반, 가슴, 아래팔, 위팔 등을 촉진 및 검진하는 것이 중요
하다.
󰠂골절과 함께 심각한 뇌 또는 배 손상이 있을 수 있기 때문에 의식소실 및 심장 등의 이상 
징후와 낙상 원인에 대해서도 평가해야 한다. 
󰠂활력징후 측정시 혈압 및 맥박을 주의 깊게 평가하고, 특히 심부정맥(불규칙한 맥박)에 
주의해야 한다.
◦ 자동차 사고1 
󰠂노화가 진행될수록 측면 또는 말초 시야가 감퇴하기 측면 충돌사고를 유발시킬 수 있다.
󰠂자동차 사고에 의한 손상은 충돌 기전에 광범위하게 의존하고, 젊은 환자들보다 사망률이 
높다.
󰠂목뼈손상은 가장 흔한 손상으로 노화로 뼈가 약하기 때문에 초기 평가단계에서 즉각적인 
목뼈 고정장치를 적용한다.
󰠂쇼크시 저혈압과 빠른맥이 일반적인 징후이나, 노인의 경우 젊은 환자보다 높게 혈압이 
측정되고, 만성 심질환 등의 약을 복용하는 경우에는 빠른맥도 나타나지 않는 등 쇼크의 일반적인 징후가 보이지 않기 때문에 심각한 자동차 사고를 당한 모든 노인환자는 쇼크 
상태로 가정하고 처치한다. 
󰠂특히 환자가 혼돈이나 흥분과 같은 정신상태 변화, 의식장애는 쇼크의 가장 흔한 징후이다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
422◦ 머리손상
󰠂낙상, 교통사고, 폭행으로 많이 발생된다.
󰠂피부가 얇고 혈관이 약하기 때문에 심각한 손상을 초래할 수 있다.
󰠂머리손상 후 의식변화가 있다면 심각한 머리손상 가능성이 있다.
󰠂혈전 용해제인 쿠마딘(Coumadin)과 같은 약물을 복용하는 환자는 경미한 손상이라도 
치명적인 출혈 위험성이 있다. 
󰠂목뼈골절 위험이 높기 때문에 항상 척추고정을 실시하고, 나이로 인한 척추변형으로 앙와위시 
머리가 척추보호대에 닿지 않을 수 있으니 담요나 수건을 이용하여 자세를 고정한다.
◦ 학대 
󰠂노인환자를 평가하고 치료할 때 정신적, 신체적 학대의 가능성에 대해서도 고려해야 한다.
󰠂학대는 가족구성원, 간병인, 다른 연장자에 의해서 일어날 수 있다.
󰠂종류로는 신체학대, 성학대, 정서 혹은 심리적 학대, 방임, 유기, 재정적 혹은 물리적 착취 
및 자기 무시 등이 있다.
󰠂종종 환자들은 학대자에 의존해서 학대 신고를 두려워하기 때문에 노인학대가 의심되면 
직접적인 신고가 필요하지 않더라도 이송 병원에 그 사실을 알리고 기록해야 한다.
◦ 의학적 응급상황 
󰠂노인환자는 젊은 사람보다 질병이 더 심각할 수 있으며, 질병의 증상이나 징후는 다를 수 
있다. 
󰠂평가할 때 항상 치명적인 질병이나 실신, 현기증, 갑작스러운 의식 혼란, 가슴통증, 
호흡곤란, 복통 등 심각한 증상에 대한 주 호소를 고려해야한다.
◦ 실신 
󰠂뇌로 가는 혈류의 저하로 발생되는 일시적인 의식 소실이며, 노인의 경우 부정맥이나 
저혈압으로 인해 발생할 수도 있다.
◦ 급성 혼돈 
󰠂다양한 질병이 있는 노인은 갑작스런 의식변화나 혼돈을 호소할 수 있다.
󰠂건강 상태에 따라 뇌졸중, 심장마비, 심각한 감염증상, 혈당, 쇼크 등 으로 인한 의식변화가 
나타날 수 있다.
󰠂의식변화가 있는 경우 평상시 의식상태와 어떻게 다른지 확인 한다.
◦ 가슴통증과 빠른호흡  
󰠂노인환자에서 심장 발작 시 가슴 불편함이 거의 없을 수 있다.
󰠂빠른호흡은 노인환자에 있어 심장에 이상이 생겼다는 징후일 수 있다.
󰠂가슴통증 또는 빠른호흡이 있는 경우 불안정한 상태임을 고려해야 하고, 고농도 산소공급과 

Part 3  Ⅴ 특수상황 응급처치 표준지침
423주의 깊게 평가를 해야 한다.
󰠂만성적인 가슴통증 환자는 니트로글리세린을 투여할 수 있다.
󰠂환자의 가슴통증, 빠른호흡은 협심증의 대표적인 증상이다.
◦ 복통 
󰠂복통은 다양한 질병의 증상으로 노인환자에서 매우 심각할 수 있다.
󰠂젊은 사람보다 충수돌기염 등 상태에 따라 사망률이 10배 이상 높다.
󰠂배 동맥 파열로 인한 복통은 치명적인 상태이기 때문에 주의해야 한다.
2. 응급처치 절차 및 방법 
◦ ‘환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침’에 따라 환자의 평가 및 처치를 시행하고 구체적인 상황에 
대해서는 해당 지침을 따른다.

환자 신체구속(Restraint)  6
환자 자신은 물론 주변 사람이나 구급대원을 해칠 우려가 있는 환자에게 환자결박을 고려할 
수 있다. 
1. 원칙
◦ 우리나라에서 구급대원에 의한 물리적 결박 등의 환자 신체구속은 허용하고 있지 않다.  공 격 적 인 
환자를 대응할 때에는 반드시 경찰의 협조를 구해 현장에 동시에 도착하도록 하는 것이 좋으며, 
만약 구급대원이 현장에 먼저 도착한 경우라면 경찰이 올 때까지 물리적 결박을 적용해서는 
안 된다.  현장에 도착한 경찰관의 소속 및 성명, 신고 시각 등을 기록해 두어야 한다.
2. 환자평가 필수항목
◦ 공격적인 행동을 유발할 수 있는 상태에 대한 고려가 필수적이다. 즉 급성 정신병적 상태 
이외에 경련 후 상태, 저혈당증, 저산소증, 뇌 손상, 약물 중독 등의 원인에 의해서도 공격적인 행동이 유발될 수 있음을 주지하고 원인감별을 위한 병력 청취를 시행한다.
3. 신체구속의 유형
◦구두 억제(Verbal restraint) ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
- 솔직하고 정확하고 차분한 말투로 접근해야 하며, 거짓말을 하거나 환자를 위협하거나 자
극하는 것은 상황을 악화시킨다. 상황을 단계적으로 천천히 해결하려 해야지 상황을 통제
하려고 해서는 안 된다.
- 직접적인 눈 맞춤은 피해야 하고 환자의 개인적인 공간에 침입하는 느낌을 주어서도 안 된다.- 불필요하거나 갑작스러운 움직임을 보여서는 안 된다.- 환자를 존중하며 환자의 존엄성을 유지하려는 태도를 보이는 것이 중요하다.- 상황이 확대될 때를 대비하여 지원 인력을 요청해 두어야 한다.- 구급대원은 빠져나올 수 있는 출입구 가까이에 위치해야 하며 환자가 출입구 가까이 위치
하도록 해서는 안된다.
 ◦ 물리적 억제(Physical restraints) ☞ ② ①
- 환자에게 적용할 수 있는 억제대는 부드러운 것(soft restraint; 천으로 된 시트나 손목 억제대 
등)과 단단한 것(hard restraint; 플라스틱이나 가죽 재질로 된 억제대)의 두 종류가 있다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
434- 환자에게 허용하는 움직임의 범위에 따라 억제 방법이 달라질 수 있다.
- 환자가 구토하거나 호흡곤란을 보이는 경우 즉시 억제대를 제거해야 한다.
◦ 화학적 억제(Chemical restraints)
- 우리나라에서 구급대원에 의한 화학적 억제는 아직 허용되지 않고 있으며 외국의 경우에도 
직접 의료지도에 따라 시행토록 규정하고 있다.
4. 신체구속 절차 및 주의사항
◦ 신고 직후 혹은 현장도착 직후 경찰에 연락하여 도움을 요청해야 하고 경찰이 동반되지 
않은 상태에서는 물리적 결박을 시행하지 않아야 한다.
◦ 환자 자신과 주변사람들을 보호할 수 있는 가장 최소한의 방법이자 가장 덜 침습적인 방법을 
사용하도록 해야 하지만, 이송 중 환자와 구급대원의 안전을 보장할 수 있는 방법은 전체 
결박(full restraint)인 경우가 대부분이다.
◦ 얼굴, 머리와 목 부위에는 아무것도 결박하지 말아야 한다. 다만 환자가 침 뱉는 행동을 
할 수 있으므로 일회용 마스크 등을 착용시킬 수는 있다.
◦ 인간적인 방법으로 억제대를 적용하며, 가능한 한 환자의 존엄성을 존중해야 한다. 환자와 
가족에게 지금 억제대를 적용할 것임을, 이것이 환자 본인과 다른 사람의 안전을 보장할 수 
있는 최선의 방법임을 설명해야 하며, 가능하다면 구속복(straight jacket)을 착용토록 한다.
◦ 억제대를 적용한 환자를 엎드린 자세로 두면, 기도 폐쇄, 심정지, 흡인 등이 발생할 수 
있으므로 금지한다.
5 .  신 체 구 속  후  환 자  감 시
 ◦ 억제대가 적용된 환자의 기도, 순환 및 호흡과 의식 상태를 자주 확인해야 한다.
 ◦ 혈압, 맥박, 호흡, 산소포화도를 지속적으로 감시(☞ ② ①)하며 이송(☞Ⓕ ② ①)한다.
 ◦ 결박을 시행한 원위 부위의(손끝, 발끝과 같은) 순환, 움직임, 감각 등을확인한다.

환자 초기 평가·처치 표준지침  1
구급대원의 가장 중요한 역할은 현장에서 환자의 생명을 위협하는 치명적 상태를 평가하고 
신속히 대처하는 것이다. 따라서 환자평가를 통하여 환자에게 직면한 문제나 잠정적으로 
생명을 위협할 수 있는 문제를 파악하여 처치의 우선순위를 결정하는 것이 매우 중요하다. 
환자평가는 현장평가 , 생명을 위협하는 문제를 파악하여 처치하기 위한 일차평가 , 병력조사, 
정밀 신체검진을 하는 이차평가 로 구성된다. 일차평가 도중에 이상이 발견되면 즉시 필요한 
응급처치를 시행하여야 한다. 일차평가 및 처치가 끝나면 병원으로 즉시 이송할지 현장에서 
이차평가를 시행하며 응급처치를 시행할지를 결정하여야 하며 즉시 이송의 대상이 되는 환자는 
이송중에 이차평가를 시행한다.1 
1. 사전평가 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
◦ 현장도착 전 구급상황실 상황요원으로부터 환자에 대한 정보를 얻고, 정보가 충분하지 않을 
경우 신고자와 통화하여 필요한 정보를 추가로 얻어 이를 이용하여 환자의 중증도 및 어떤 
준비물이 필요할지를 추정하고, 필요한 지침을 미리 숙지한다.
2. 현장도착 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
◦ 현장의 안정성을 확인하고 확보한다.
󰠂안전하지 않다면 현장으로부터 안전거리를 유지한 후 구급차를 세우고 다른 구조자(소방관이나 
경찰)들이 안전하다는 지시할 때까지 기다린 후 상황의 성격, 길의 종류, 교통흐름, 다른 차량의 위치 등을 파악하여 안전하고 가능한 환자와 가까운 장소에 차를 세운다.
◦ 개인보호장비(PPE, personal protective equipment) 착용을 고려한다.◦ 신체분비물을 격리한다.
◦ 환자가 있는 위치와 환자에게 가는 경로를 확인하고 발생한 사건(구조의 성질)과 환자의 
숫자를 평가하여 추가지원 여부를 결정한다.

3. 환자 접근 
◦ 현장에서 환자에게 접근하면서 손상기전이나 질병에 대한 정보를 확인한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂외상이 있다면 상처를 입힌 특이한 기전이나 환자에게 작용한 힘을 판단한다. 외상의 성격
과 방향, 속도, 충돌, 차량 손상 상태 등 세부사항을 확인하고 이를 통해 척추 손상의 조짐

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
442이 있는지 확인하고 필요한 경우 ‘척추 고정’ 지침을 따른다.
󰠂현장으로 접근하면서 발견한 약물, 장비, 물건 등을 통하여 질병을  파악한다.
◦ 재난이나 다수사상자 발생사고에 의해 다수의 환자 발생시에는 ‘다수사상자재난 
119구급대응 표준매뉴얼’에 준하여 중증도 분류 및 처치를 한다. ☞ ② ①
4 .  일 차 평 가  및  처 치
일차평가의 목적은 치명적인 병변이나 손상을 빨리 발견하고 치료하는 것으로서, 동시다발
적으로 평가가 이루어져야 하며 발견된 심각한 이상은 발견 즉시 처치한다. 현장에서 별도 
처치가 불필요한 경우, 일차평가는 2분 이내 에 종결함을 원칙으로 한다.3 
◦ 전체적 초기평가: 15~30초 동안 전체적인 조사로 즉시 필요한 결정적인 처치를 찾아낸다. 
☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂대략적 연령, 성별
󰠂전체적이고 대략적인 의식수준, 호흡기, 순환기의 상황들
󰠂이를 통해 즉각적인 생명을 위협하는 질병이나 손상을 확인하고 즉시 처치한다.
◦ 의식상태: AVPU 분류법 에 따라 환자의식 상태를 측정한다.4-6 ☞  Ⓕ  ②  ①
󰠂A (명료): 환자가 스스로 눈을 뜨고 질문에 분명한 답변을 한다.
󰠂V (언어지시에 반응): 환자가 스스로 눈을 뜰 수 없고 시간, 장소, 사람을 알아보지 못하지만 
구급대원의 구두지시에 반응한다.
󰠂P (통증자극에 반응): 언어지시에는 반응이 없지만 신체에 통증을 주면 움직이거나 고함치
는 반응을 보인다.
󰠂U (무반응): 환자가 통증에 대해서 반응하지 않는다.
󰠂의식상태가 P 이하인 경우 적절한 방법으로 기도를 확보하고 100% 산소를 투여한다.
◦ 기도(airway)
󰠂‘환자의 기도유지가 적당한가?, 환자가 숨을 쉬는가?’ 를 관찰한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰠂적절하지 않은 기도상태일 경우 기도를 개방하여 확보한다. ☞ ② ①
󰋼경추(목뼈)손상이 의심되지 않는다면  머리기울임­턱들어올리기(Head tilt chin lift) 술식 을 
이용한다.
󰋼경추(목뼈)손상이 의심되는 경우, 경추(목뼈)를 고정한 상태에서 턱들어올리기(jaw 
thrust)을 시행한다.
󰋼이물에 의한 기도폐쇄가 의심 되는 경우, 기도 이물 지침을 따른다.
󰋼기도확보 후 기도기를 이용하여 기도를 유지한다. ☞ ② ①
⦁ 구역반사가 없는 경우 , 입인두기도기(oropharyngeal airway) 를 사용한다.

Part 3  Ⅵ 술기 지침
443⦁ 구역반사가 존재하는 경우 , 코인두기도기(nasal airway) 를 사용한다.
󰠂기도 내 분비물이 많은 경우  흡인기 를 사용하여 제거한다. ☞ ② ①
󰋼위와 같은 방법에도 기도 확보가 안 되거나 충분한 환기가 이루어지지 않을 경우, 전문기도
유지술을 시행한다. ☞ ①7
◦ 호흡(Breathing)
󰠂다음과 같은 요소를 평가하여 호흡의 적절성을 확인한다. ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
󰋼분당 호흡수(rate) : 15초 동안 계산하여 4를 곱하거나 30초 동안 계산하여 2를 곱한다. 
정상범위는 성인에서 분당 12~20회이고 13세 미만 어린이에서는 분당 20~30회이며, 신
생아는 분당 30~50회이다. 비정상범위의 호흡수는 부적절한 분당 호흡량을 의심할 수 
있 고  환 기 의  보 조 가  필 요 할  수  있 다 .8
󰋼깊이(depth) : 각각의 호흡에서 흉부팽창의 양으로 보이거나 느껴지는 정도로 ‘정상’, ‘얕
음’ 또는 ‘깊음’ 으로 평가한다. 
󰋼호흡노력(effort) : 정상적으로 호흡은 의식적 사고나 특별한 자세 또는 체위에 관계없이 
동통이 없고 의식적 노력이 없으며 소음이 없는 과정이므로 호흡을 위한 노력이 필요한 
경우 ‘호흡곤란’ 으로 평가한다. 
󰋼언어(speech) : 의식이 있는 환자에서 말할 수 있는 능력은 호흡노력과 산소화의 확실한 
측정방법으로 호흡곤란이 있는 환자는 각 문장마다 의식적인 정지를 해야만 말할 수 있다. 
󰋼의식수준 : 환자가 지남력이 있고 정상적으로 말하고 충분히 의식이 있다면 환기와 산소화가 
그 순간 적절하다고 결론 내릴 수 있다.
󰋼소리(sound) : 기포음, 구룩구룩 거리는 소리(gurgling), 코고는 소리(snoring) 또는 
천명음은 즉시 주의를 기울여야 하는 하부기도 폐쇄 문제이다. 
󰋼청진(auscultation) : 청진기를 사용하여 양측 폐 호흡음의 존재와 대칭성, 잡음 등을 확인
󰋼청색증(cyanosis): 순환이 잘되는 환자에서 저산소증은 피부와 점막을 통해 보이는 혈관에 
푸르게 보이는 적혈구 색의 변화로 나타난다. 이와 같은 청색증은 점막(입술)과 손톱 밑에서 
가장 쉽게 볼 수 있으며, 저산소증의 명백한 지침이다. 그러나 청색증이 없다고 해서 
저산소증이 없다고 생각해서는 안된다.
󰠂산소포화도 측정기를 부착하여 혈중 산소포화도를 감시하고 전문기도술을 이용하는 경우 
호기말 이산화탄소(end­tidal CO 2) 감시를 고려한다.☞ ② ①
󰠂환자의 호흡이 부적절한 경우  
󰋼무호흡 의 경우, 심폐소생술 의 절차를 실시한다.(‘구급단계 심폐소생술 술기지침’ 참조)

5. 응급/비응급 평가25 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
환자의 나이, 전신건강상태 및 일차 평가 과정을 통해 확인되었거나 배제된 상태를 기반으로 
환자의 임상적 인상을 내리고 중증도를 다음과 같이 분류한다. 
◦ 응급 환자
󰠂즉각적으로 생명을 위협하는 질병이나 손상이 있는 환자
󰠂생명을 위협하게 되거나 심각한 전신적 충격을 주는 질병이나 손상이 있는 환자
󰠂구급대원이 결정하기 어렵거나 일차평가와 관련하여 풀리지 않는 의문이 있다면 응급 환자
로 생각하여 처치한다.
◦ 비응급 환자
󰠂생명위협의 가능성이 없는 질병이나 손상이 확인된 환자
6. 이송 준비와 이송 ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
◦ 응급 환자  
이러한 범주의 환자는 현장에서의 처치에도 불구하고 안정화되려면 의료기관에서 결정적인 
처치(수혈, 외과적 수술 등)가 필요하다. 따라서 평가진행 단계에서 지연됨이 없이 적절한 운송수단으로 초기에 치료 가능한 병원으로 이송하는 것이 가장 중요한 치료의 우선순위이다. 
󰠂일차평가에서의 소견을 검토하고 즉각적으로 필요한 처치를 시행하고 나서 긴급 환자는 
되도록 빨리 이송준비를 해서 지체 없이 가장 가깝고 적절한 병원으로 이송한다. 
󰠂이송 도중 구급대원은 사용할 수 있다면 산소를 공급하고 중요한 처치를 계속한다. 이송 

Part 3  Ⅵ 술기 지침
447도중까지 미루어진 주요처치(정맥 내 수액, 심장감시)는 이때 시작되어야 한다.
󰠂만약 시간이 허락되고 이송과정의 주된 처치 항목이 이루어졌다면 이차평가를 수행하여 
필요한 부가적 처치를 시행한다.26
◦ 비응급 환자  
이러한 범주의 환자는 생명을 위협하는 손상/내과적 상태가 없고, 심각한 계통적 연관이 
없으며 배제된 경우이다. 응급 상황이 없기 때문에 모든 이차평가를 확인하고 이송준비와 이송을 하기 전에 처치한다. 
󰠂환자가 비응급으로 결정되면
 구급대원은 평가를 계속하고 추가적 병력을 얻기 위한 노력을 
한다. 
󰠂이차평가를 통해 발견된 각 개별 항목에 대한 처치(드레싱, 붕대, 부목고정 등)를 하고 
환자를 적절한 자세로 취한 후 병원으로 이송을 한다. 
7 .  이 차 평 가  및  처 치
일차평가 및 처치가 끝나면 환자에게 무엇을 하고 있고, 왜 하는지 설명하고 난 후 병력 
조사 및 활력징후를 측정하면서 이차평가를 시작하게 된다. 이차평가는 모든 징후를 재평가하면서 머리에서 발끝까지 모든 신체부위를 관찰하고 이학적 검사를 시행하는 것이다. 따라서 
일차평가에서 발견하지 못했던 중요한 손상이나 이상을 발견하거나 진단하여 처치함으로써 
환자상태가 다시 악화되는 것을 방지한다.
27 
◦ 병력과 신체검진

있도록 응급구조사 교육기관(소방학교, 임상실습수련기관, 기타 응급구조사의 신규/ 
보수교육기간으로 인정받은 기관, 응급의료기관 등)에서 매년 4시간 이상의 교육을 받을 
수 있도록 적극적으로 노력하여야 한다.30
󰊲기계식 가슴압박장비를  이용한 심폐소생술31
환자를 들것으로 이동하거나, 운행 중인 구급차, 열차 및 항공기 등 좁은 공간, 소생술이 
길어지거나 인력이 부족한 경우 또는 감염병노출 위험 등 특수한 상황에서는 심폐소생술은 
술기 자체의 질(Quality)과 효과(Effectiveness)가 떨어질 수 있고, 시간이 지남에 따라서 구급대원의 피로도가 증가하여 심폐소생술의 질은 더욱 감소하게 되어 일정 수준의 
심폐소생술의 질과 효과를 유지 시켜줄 수 있는 기구(Mechanical Device)가 개발되었다.

󰠂소생술을 시작하였지만, 시행 중 ‘소생술 유보’의 조건이 확인된 경우
󰠂직접의료지도를 요청하여 ‘소생술 중단’의 의료지도를 받은 경우6
4. 발생가능한 부작용/합병증7-9
◦ 전기화상
󰠂제세동 가능리듬이 아닐 때 적용하면 심실세동, 무수축등 부정맥 발생 가능 
5 .  술 기  절 차  및  방 법  ☞ Ⓕ ② ①
◦ 전체적인 흐름은‘심정지’ 지침과 ‘구급단계 심폐소생술’ 술기 지침을 따른다.
◦ 자동심장충격기가 이미 준비가 되어있으면서 환자의 허탈(collapse)이 직접 목격되는 상황이 
아니라면, 자동심장충격기가 준비되는 동안 구급단계 심폐소생술을 제공한다.10-12 
◦ 자동심장충격기가 도착하면 전원을 켠 후 가슴압박을 지속하면서 패드를 흉골의 우측 쇄골 
아래와 좌측 겨드랑이 중앙선의 심전도 V6 level 높이에 부착한다.

Part 3  Ⅵ 술기 지침
463◦ 리듬분석 버튼을 누르고 가슴압박을 중단시킨다.
◦ 제세동이 필요하지 않은 경우  즉시 가슴압박을 비롯한 심폐소생술을 다시 시작한다.
◦ 제세동이 필요한 경우  충전버튼을 누르고(장비에 따라 자동으로 충전되는 경우도 있음) 
충전되는 동안 가슴압박을 시행한다. 충전이 완료되면 가슴압박을 멈추고 환자에게서 
떨어지라고 알린 후 제세동을 시행한다. 제세동을 시행한 직후 바로 가슴압박을 비롯한 심폐소생술을 재개한다.
◦ 자동심장충격기 리듬은 5주기(30:2를 1주기)마다 혹은 2분마다 분석한다.
13
󰠂기침, 움직임, 호흡, 호기말 이산화탄소의 급격한 상승 등 자발순환회복의 증거 혹은 맥박이 
촉지되면 가슴압박을 잠시 멈추고 심전도 리듬을 확인 후 자발순환이 회복되었다고 
판단되면 즉시 구급차로 이송한다.
󰠂정해진 시간까지 소생술을 실시하였더라도 자발순환이 회복하지 않았거나 제세동 가능한 
리듬이 나타나지 않은 경우는 구급차로 이송한다.14
◦ 이송중인 구급차에서는 자동심장충격기를 이용한 리듬 분석과 제세동을 시행하지 않는다. 
단, 구급대원 판단상 필요한 경우 안전한 장소에 구급차 정차 후 시행할 수 있다.
6. 자동심장충격기 패드 부착 시 주의사항
◦ 패드위치15,16
󰠂우측가슴앞쪽과 좌측액와 중앙선 아래쪽을 원칙으로 한다. 
󰠂구급대원이 판단하여 필요할 경우 아래의 위치에 부착할 수 있다.
󰋼가슴 앞쪽과 뒤쪽(anteroposterior)
󰋼가슴앞쪽과 왼쪽 견갑골(어깨뼈)아래쪽(anterior­left infrascapular)
󰋼가슴앞쪽과 오른쪽 견갑골(어깨뼈)아래쪽(anterior­right infrascapular)
󰠂여성의 경우  유방조직 위를 피하여 패드를 부착한다.17
󰠂체내삽입형 심장충격기가 있는 환자의 경우 , 체내삽입형 심장충격기나 심박조율기에서 
직접 부착하지 말고 떨어져 부착한다.
󰠂자동심장충격기 패드를 피부 흡수형 제약패치에 직접 부착하지 않는다.
◦ 가슴에 털이 많은 경우는 면도 후 패드를 부착한다.18
◦ 환자가 물에 있거나, 흉부가 물에 젖어 있거나 혹은 환자가 땀에 흠뻑 젖어 있다면  물에서 
꺼내 간단히 수건으로 물을 닦은 후 패치를 부착한다.

구급대원  현장응급처치  표준지침
4647. 영아·소아 처치시 고려해야 할 사항19-21
◦ 영아는 자동심장충격기보다는 수동심장충격기 를 사용하는 것이 낫다.
◦ 수동제세동기가 없다면 소아용 충격량 감쇠기가 있는 자동심장충격기를 영아에게 사용하도
록 한다.
◦ 8세 미만의 소아는 소아용 충격량 감쇠기가 있는 자동심장충격기를 사용한다. 
수동심장충격기와 충격량 감쇠기가 없는 경우 에너지량 조절 가능한 성인용 
자동심장충격기를 사용할 수 있다.

양압 환기와 보조환기술식(인공 호흡)  5
환기란 호흡의 초기 구성요소로 ‘외부 공기가 기도를 통해 폐포 안에서 적절히 교환하는 
것’이다. 산소공급이 중단되면 단지 4~6분 후 에 비가역적인 뇌세포 사망이 시작되기 때문에 
환자가 무호흡이거나 스스로 적절한 환기를 제공할 수 없을 경우에는 충분한 공기교환과 
확실한 산소 공급을 위해 구급대원은 환기를 제공하거나 호흡보조를 이용해 증가시켜 주어야 한다. 환기 제공을 위해 여섯 가지 다른 유형의 장비를 제공할 수 있다. 
󰊱구강대 안면 shield  ☞  ②  ①
󰊲구강대 마스크(일방향 밸브)  ☞  ②  ①

󰠂환자 머리 근처에 휴대용자동인공호흡기를 놓고 조절부와 환자밸브를 꺼내면서 산소
공급원과 연결되어 있는지 점검하고 연결호스들이 헐겁거나 꼬여 있는지 확인한다. 
󰠂산소탱크를 열고 흡기 시간 조절부위를 “어른” 이나 “어린이”에 설정한다.(성인:1.5-2초, 
어린이: 0.75-1초)

환자의 기도를 개방하고 마스크를 입과 코에 밀착시켜 미리 설정한 흡기/호기 주기와 환자의 흉부 상승 정도를 주의깊게 관찰하여 다음 흡기주기 시작 전에 호기가 완전히 되는지 
확인한다. 
󰠂흡기시작 초기에 압력제한경고음이 울리면
 기도개방이 잘 안되어 있는 것이므로 기도
개방을 다시 시도하고, 압력제한경고음이 흡기 끝에 울린다면  호흡량 설정이 과도한 
것이므로 호흡량 조절부의 설정 값을 낮게 다시 설정한다.
󰠂일단 압력경고음이 없이 흡기시 적당한 흉부상승과 함께 호흡이 이루어질 경우 청진기로 
양쪽 폐에서 청진을 하고 상복부를 청진하여 위에 가스 흡입이 되지 않는지 확인한다.

Part 3  Ⅵ 술기 지침
489󰠂환자를 반듯하게 눕히고 접힌 타월을 환자의 목과 어깨 아래에 넣어 머리를 최대한 신전시켜 
가슴과 목앞 부분을 가능한 일직선으로 만들고 턱을 들어 올린다.
󰠂기공(목 부위 기관과 연결된 구멍)에 있는 연결 튜브의 크기와 맞는 백밸브마스크를 연결한 
후 양압환기를 시행한다. 
󰠂기관이 인두와 통하지 않고 완전히 목을 통해 호흡을 하는 환자가 아니라 부분적인 연결부가 
존재하여 목호흡을 하는 환자에서는 흡기 때 주어지는 얼마간의 공기가 입과 코를 막지 
않는다면 이를 통해 샐 수 있으므로 두 명이상의 구급대원이 현장에서 처치를 할 경우 에는 
한 명은 매 흡기동안에 환자의 입과 코를 닫고 호기동안에는 개방시킨다. 
6. 주의사항
◦ 일단 환자가 환기가 되지 않거나 환기가 부적절하여 실제적인 환기가 되지 않는다고 판단되
면 다른 이유나 추가 평가를 위해 환기 제공을 지연해서는 안된다.
◦ 환기제공 전에 명백하게 기도유지가 선행되어야 한다.
◦ 백밸브마스크 제품의 상표와 모델이 같으면 부품들을 모두 사용할 수 있지만 일반적으로 
이러한 부분들은 서로 교환 시에 안전하지 않다.3
7. 소아에서 고려해야 할 사항
◦ 소아들의 높은 호흡회수로 인해 더 빠른 재충전 백이 필요하기 때문에 소아용 bag을 사용하
도록 하고, 적절한 크기의 장비가 없을 때에만 성인용 bag을 사용할 수 있다. 
◦ 유아와 작은 어린이에게 마스크를 씌우기 위해, 하악골을 올릴 때 기관조직에 부적절하게 
손가락을 얹어 압력을 가하지 않도록 한다. 
◦ 7세 이하 어린이일 때 몸통에 비해 머리가 크기 때문에 유아를 단단한 평면에 반드시 눕힐 
경우 몸통 아래에 패드를 이용하여 3 cm 정도 올려 준다.
◦ 수요밸브(demand valve) 호흡장치는 성인들을 위해 제작되었으므로 소아환자들에게 사용
해서는 안된다.

Epinephrine(에피네프린) ☞ ◯ 특 ◯스 5
 Epinephrine은 자연적으로 동물의 부신에서 얻을 수 있는 카테콜아민에 존재하지만 
인공적으로 합성되기도한다. α와β아드레날린 수용체에 직접작용하며 이 약물은 가장 효과적인 
α수용체 작용인자이다. Epinephrine은 안면부동맥과 땀샘을 제외한 모든 교감신경계 작용을 
나타낼 수 있다. 약물의 β1효과는 심근의 수축력을 강화시키고 수축기 혈압을 상승시키나 이완기 혈압을 감소시키며, 또한 심박수와 심박출량을 상승시킨다. 약물의β2효과는 기관지 
평활근을 이완시키고 기도저항을 유발할 수 있는 점액분비를 억제한다. 또한 α효과는 
기관지세동맥을 수축시키고 히스타민분비를 억제하여, 울혈, 부종을 감소시키고 1회 호흡량과 폐활량을 증가시킨다.
Epinephrine은 또한 피부, 점막, 콩팥의 세동맥은 수축시키는 반면 골격근의 혈관은 이완
시키며, 자궁의 평활근육을 이완시키고 자궁수축을 억제한다. Epinephrine의 중추신경계의 
영향은 말초효과에 기인한 것이라고 믿어진다.

Amiodarone(아미오다론) ☞ ◯ 스 6
Amiodarone은 모든 심장조직에 직접적으로 영향을 미치는 데 있어서 다른 항부정맥제와 
다르다. 이것은 안정전위막이 중요영향을 미치지 않는 불응기와 활동전위의 기간을 연장시키는 
것으로 생각된다. IV로 투여하는 것은 민무늬근혈관을 이완시키고 말초혈관의 저항성을 
감소시키며, 관상동맥의 혈류를 증가시킨다. Amiodarone은 또한 교감신경자극을 억제하는 
효과도 있다.1
1. 적응증2
◦ 생명을 위협하는 심실과 심실성 빠른맥을 치료하기 위해서 사용한다.
◦ 심실성 빈맥과 상심실성 빈맥 치료시 사용되며 특히 제세동, CPR, 혈압상승제 적용에도 
심실세동/무맥성 심실빈맥이 지속될 때 사용 고려
2. 금기 및 주의사항1,2
◦ 이 약물은 자동능과, 수축, 전도능력을 감소시키기 때문에 과민성이 있는 환자에게 IV 투여는 
금기이다. 인공심박조율기(Pacemaker)를 사용할 수 없다면 심한 동성느린맥, 고도 방실차단이 있는 경우에 amiodarone을 사용하지 않는다. 심한 간질환 환자에서는 
amiodarone이 간에서 대사되므로 조심해서 사용해야 한다. 또한 임신한 여성에서도

91 9 󰊲구급차 구급장비 및 기능
 구급차에 필요한 장비는 법률로 제정하고 있다. 그러나 
의료 기술의 발전과 사회여건의 변화에 따라 새로운 처
치가 도입되기도 하고 이전에 효과적이라고 했던 처치
가 실제로 그렇지 않음이 밝혀지기도 한다. 따라서 구급차에 필요한 장비와 약품에 대한 규정은 의학적인 연구 
결과에 근거하여 지속적으로 관리, 감독되어야 하며 적
절한 장비와 약품을 갖추도록 할 필요가 있다. 그러나 새로운 장비나 약품의 필요성이 제기될 때마다 매번 법
률을 새로 제정할 수는 없는 것이므로 차후 구급 지도의
사 협의회의 자문회의 등을 통하여 지속적으로 관리 감독 및 변경이 필요할 것이다

률로 뇌졸중이 있으며, 3가지 모 두 해당되면 
85% 확률로 뇌졸중을 발견하는 재현성이 좋고 민 감도도 좋은 선별검사이다.
2. 구급대원은 얼굴마비를 평가하기 위해 이마를 
찡그리거나 혀를 내밀 거나, 입을  오므리는 등의 이학적 검진을 실시한다.
3. 구급대원은 팔의 편측 근력저하를 평가하기 위해 
양측 눈을 감고 손 바닥을 위로 해 양 팔을 똑바로 앞으로 뻗어 10초간 유지시킨다. 한 쪽이 
내측으로 회전하면서 떨어지거나, ‘탁’하고 
떨어지면 마비가 있다고 판단한다.
4. 구급대원은 환자가 혀가 잘 돌아가지 않아 구
음장애가 있는지 혹은 발음이 불가능하거나 
부적절한 언어를 사용하는 실어 등이 있는지를 평가하고 기록 한다.
5. 얼굴마비나 팔 위약이 하나라도 비대칭이거나

외 119항공대, 특수구조단 등 현장 대응 소방기관이 적용 대상이며, 소방체험관, 소방학교 등 현장 대응 소방기
관이 아닌 경우에는 본 지침의 적용대상이 아니나, 본

며, 교과서적인 이론 내용 의 나열은 피하고자 했다. 또
한 본 지침의 감염관리 내용은 119 구급대원 현장응급 처치 표준지침을 개선하여 작성하였으므로 두 지침 간 
내용이 상이한 부분은 본 지 침을 활용한다.
본 지침은 국내·외 감염병, 감염관리 지침을 참고·인용하여 제작되어, 구급대원의 감염관리 행위가 표준적으로 
제시되나, 감염병의 종류가 다양하고 출동마다 현장 상 
황이 달라 이를 그대로 적용하기에는 한계가 있다. 따라서 본 지침에서 정하는 감염 관리의 모든 행위는 절대적
인 원칙을 정한 것이 아니며, 복잡한 현장 상황 등에 따 
라 변형하여 적용할 수 있다.특히, 코로나19 범유행으로 감염관리의 기대치가 높아
졌지만, 본 지침에서는 코로나 19 같은 감염병 재난 상
황을 기준으로 삼지 않았다. 일반 구급출동 및 현장 활동을 기준으로 일상적인 감염관리 부분을 담았다.
메르스나 코로나19 같은 감염병 재난 상황 및 각 감염병
에 대한 표준지침이 별도로 제시되어 있는 경우 그 지침을 우선적으로 적용한다.

   󰠂아나필락시스는 피부, 점막, 호흡기계, 소화기
계, 심혈관계, 신경계 등에서 최소 두 개 이
상의 장기에서 임상증상이 발생하는 경우가 
전형적인 형태이나, 일부 벌독 알레르기 환자에서는 저혈압, 빈맥, 흉통과 같은 갑작스러
운 심혈관계의 반응이 단독으로 나타나기도 
한다. 
   󰠂아나필락시스의 진단에서 주의할 점은 저혈압
이 없더라도 두 곳 이상의 장기 증상이 있는 
경우 아나필락시스로 진단할 수 있다는 점이다. 혈압 저하가 발생하기 전에 다른 장기에
서 알레르기 반응이 시작되어 진행할 수 있으
므로 혈압 저하 외에 다른 장기에서 보이는 임상 증상에도 관심을 기울여 평가하고 판단
해야 한다. 
   󰠂이하와 같은 아나필락시스의 진단기준을 숙지
